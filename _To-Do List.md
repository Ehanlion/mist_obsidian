List of tasks on my mind to work on:

			- [x] wild shape learning
			- [ ] Nature/Survival gives potion making skills
			- [x] nature-related spell casting
				- [x] Figure our reward spells / spells to emulate
	- [ ] Add good stuff about sylvia starlight
		- [ ] I want there to be something about finding her grave but not immediately knowing its her grave BEFORE they talk to the green order and learn more. 
	- [ ] Work on the mission pertaining to sylvia starlight
	- [ ] work on the potions mission for Pombo Wrinkle and develop a cool exploration, sneaking, hunting, and foraging mission. 
	- [ ] Understand and finalize the potion making system. Slim down the potion making levelling and make it easier to use.

	- [ ] split it into multiple missions
		- [ ] Learn from locals in Kelswin's home town about the van 
		- [ ] gathering info from towns surrounding the vanishings
		- [ ] there should be something to do exploring the creatures behind the vanishings
		- [ ] This should tie into the large, inland sea caves.
		- [ ] The final boss should be a massive crab, mind controlling ocean creatures, mutating them, and causing they to raid the villages
			- [ ] the stolen people are used for information and as worker drones since the crab is mining the sea caves for minerals

		- [ ] Work on his path through the Marauders
