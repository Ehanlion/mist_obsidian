List of tasks on my mind to work on:

- [ ] Work on the Green Order Missions
	- [ ] Finish up the entering the green order missions
	- [ ] Add good stuff about sylvia starlight
		- [ ] I want there to be something about finding her grave but not immediately knowing its her grave BEFORE they talk to the green order and learn more. 
	- [ ] Work on the mission pertaining to sylvia starlight
- [ ] Finish the Potions/Harvesting/Foraging system
	- [ ] Find a way to neatly have a list for each region
	- [ ] Read through botanicals book mother gave me
	- [ ] Create a full list of all the potions
	- [ ] Sort the list by difficulty (use the resource in the green order mission)
	- [ ] Make the *fantasy* foraged ingredients into real forageable ingredients from the book mom gave me. Keep the harvestable ingredients the same
