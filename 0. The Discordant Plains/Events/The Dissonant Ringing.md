# Description
	As you walk the plains, a faint but constant ringing whines against your ears. Its faint, but it sets your teeth on edge. It is like someone, far in the distance, is scraping a sharp blade against a chalk-board. However, aside from that, the plains are calm and green. Only in the far distances where you see the rises of Lake Middle-Mist's ridges or the far edges of the Deep Woods can you be reminded that you are not stranded in a flat sea of grass. 

Anyone who travels through the [[The Discordant Plains]] knows about the Ringing. Its the name-sake of the plains. It is a persistent, constant grating and scraping sounds that whistles from afar. 

# Getting the Insanity:
The dissonant ringing can easily cause madness, in fact the plains are prowled by devolved creatures called [[The Lost Prowlers]], creatures who succumbed to the ringing and are mindlessly hunting the plains. 

#### No protection:
If a player wears NO ear protection, they are taken under the effects of the Dissonant ringing immediately:

	A player WITHOUT ear protection, starts to make saves the moment they can hear the sounds of the plains. Make a DC 15 charisma saving throw. On a failure, the madness takes hold.
#### With protection:
If a player wears any ear protection, outside of **a silence spell**, they still have to make saves immediately: 

	A player WITH ear protection, starts to make saves the moment they care hear the sounds of the plains. Only with ear protection, this is an easier feat. Make a DC 12 charisma saving throw. On a failure, the madness takes hold.

# Changing the DC near the Flutes:
The closer the party gets to [[The Solemn Flutes]], the higher the save DC is against the Dissonant Ringing. If the party is within 30 miles of [[The Solemn Flutes]], the DC of the save increases by 3. 
#### Stages of Madness:
A player is considered 'gone to the madness' if they fail 3 more times than they succeed. This is best demonstrated with an example:

> Poppy and Brock go into the Discordant Plains. They will travel for a week to get to the other side. Poppy fails 4 times and succeeds 3 times against the effect. She has **one level** of madness. Brock fails 5 times and succeeds 2 times. He has **three levels** of madness, and to most is now considered 'gone to the madness,' fated to roam the plains as on of [[The Lost Prowlers]].

If at any point you have **failed 3 times more than you succeeded** you are gone to the madness. 

# What does the Insanity do? 
The insanity takes hold in multiple stages and gets progressively worse the longer you go without saving against it.
