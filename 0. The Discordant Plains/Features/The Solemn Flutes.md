	A stone circle stands out from the wide open plains. You can hear a ringing, chorus-like sound of out of tune notes grating against your ears, louder than before.

# Curse of the Flutes:
The stones were originally enchanted to be beautiful to listen to by [[The Many]] (not that anyone on Mist would necessarily). They were given, through powerful magical workings, the ability to change their sounds to create symphonic music. However as the ages wore on, and people tried to destroy the Flutes (and as weather eroded the stones, causing them to be out of tune), the magic that allowed the Flute to play beautiful, sweeping tunes slowly corrupted. It was enchanted to **preserve** its music and, even though that music became corrupted, the Flutes still tried to preserve the sound at any cost. It manifested a curse which would be bestowed upon any who tried to touch or alter the stones. 
# Avoiding the Curse:
If a player begins to dance, correctly discerning that the Flute's original purpose was to entertain, then the Flutes magically try to change their corrupted music to match the players dancing. If enough players dance together and in sync, the stones begin to glow and the corrupted sound seems to lessen just a little bit. 

# The Out of Tune Theory:
This an alternative idea for the curse above.

Originally, the Flutes were enchanted by [[The Many]] to play a great symphony of sounds, one that would last hours of unique and beautiful music. The stones were magically moved into a position that would allow them to play the symphony. The symphony was originally played by [[Cleophas]] and [[Marwood]] (who were adept musicians from [[The Many]]). This fact is not known to the people of Mist yet.

However as the ages wore on, the magic that enchanted the Flutes to play their beautiful symphony eroded alongside the stones. Their music became out of tune, distorted, and corrupted. This strange, corrosive sound causes [[The Dissonant Ringing]] that echoes across the plains today.

The magic was also enchanted to protect the Flutes. Touch it would cause spikes of pain and corruption through those who lay their hands on the Flutes. 

If players begin to sing in the immediate presence of the Flutes, something special happens. If the sound is strong, sung by many, it can re-invigorate the stone's magic. The stones will shift with the magic, the dimples, holes, and carvings on them will re-orient themselves, and the Flutes will take up the new tune.
