**Description.**

*This item requires attunement.*

**Properties.**
- These gauntlets require a minimum strength score of 16 to wield. 
- These gauntlets grant advantage against saving throws from spells. 
- Once per long rest, you can attempt to strip spells off of a creature. A 90 ft. cone of disruptive energy ripples from your hands as you clash the gauntlets tougher. Each creature concentrating on a spell within the cone must make a DC 23 concentration saving throw. On a failure, the target looses concentration on their spell and they take (1d10) damage for every spell level of the concentrated spell. On a success, they take half damage and don't lose concentration. 
- These gauntlets allow the user to cast the *dispel magic* spell. Instead of using the creature's spellcasting ability modifier, these gauntlets use the wearer's strength for the dispelling check. This ability can be used a number of times equal to the creature's proficiency bonus. If they fail to dispel the effect, the wearer suffers (2d6) psychic damage.
