**Description.** This shield is a lattice of metal with bubbly water magically stuck between the lattice structure. The fringes of the shield are clasped with fine, hardened coral. 

**Properties.**
- This shield functions as a +1 shield, giving you a +3 bonus overall to your AC. It must be wielded with one hand.
- As part of your movement, you can invoke the shield to launch you into the air, surrounded by a shimmering bubble. You immediately gain (4d6) temporary hit points. You are immediately thrown up 60 feet directly up in the air, or vertically as high as the space you are in allows. You float in this space until the start of your next turn where you drift down to the ground. While descending, you can move laterally in the air as if it were difficult terrain. This ability recharges at dawn.
