**Description.** This mundane prayer mat has small magical runes embroidered into its dusty fabrics. It is old and worn looking.

**Properties.** 
- This mat must be used by a creature that has the ability to casts spells.
- If you meditate on the prayer mat for at least 15 minutes while taking a short rest, you regain 1 spell slot of 5th level or lower when you finish your short rest. You must be taking a short rest to gain these benefits. At the end of the short rest roll a D20 and if you roll a 1, you regain all expended spell slots and the Prayer Mat loses its magic forever.
