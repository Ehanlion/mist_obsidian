**Description.** This long stave appears to be made from foaming bubbles but as you grab it, the rod is completely solid to the touch. 

**Properties.**
- This item has *3 charges*, it recharges at dawn. 
- While holding the rod, you can use your action to expend one of the charges to conjure a bubble around a creature within 30 ft. The target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained in a 10 foot diameter sphere of water. If the creature is Huge or larger, it automatically succeeds on this saving throw. A creature trapped in this way is restrained unless it has a swimming speed, and can't breathe unless it can breathe water.
- The orb extinguishes any fire effects and negates and acid effects.
- The bubble floats in the exact spot for 1 minute. The bubble has 50 hit points and an AC of 8. It has resistance to fire, acid, slashing, and bludgeoning damage and vulnerability to piercing damage. A creature inside the bubble has resistance to fire, slashing, and bludgeoning damage. 
- This rod can be commanded to take liquid form and stored in a small glass vial.
