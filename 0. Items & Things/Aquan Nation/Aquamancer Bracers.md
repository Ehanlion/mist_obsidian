**Description.** These dulled, metallic braces are engraved with motifs of not only the raging sea, but also [[The Stormlord]]. In the engravings are whirlpools of waters, raging storms, and powerful currents being depicted in carvings. These bracers subtly drip with water, even when they are not wet. 

*These bracers require attunement.*

**Properties.**
- You gain the ability to cast [Shape Water](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shape-water), at will.
- You gain the ability to cast [Wall of Water](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-water) once per long rest. When you cast the spell in this way, it is not considered concentration for you, but lasts only for 1 minute. The [[Aquamancer Bracers]] hold concentration for you, and glow a vibrant blue, casting dim light in a 60 ft. radius. 
- When you are underwater, you ignore verbal components of spells you cast.
