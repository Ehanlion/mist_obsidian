- This weapon deals an additional (1d6) cold damage when it hits a target, as frost of the deep, cold sea leeches into your target. 

**Tidal Cleave:** (1/day)
Once per long rest and as an *action*, you unleash the power of the sea in a massive slash, sending a tumbling wave of water towards your enemies in a 30 foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or take (5d8) bludgeoning damage and be pushed back 30 feet. Recharges at dawn.
