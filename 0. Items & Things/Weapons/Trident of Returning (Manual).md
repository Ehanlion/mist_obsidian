# Description:
The manual trident of returning is a trident with a hole drilled at the handle end where a length of silken rope has been tied to it. The rope is 60 feet long, just the length of the long range on a trident.
# Mechanics:
A player can use their bonus action to pull the trident back to them. They must make a DC 15 athletics check or fail to return the trident to their hand with that bonus action.
