**Description.** The [[Siren's Locket]] can be held firmly in the palm of your hand. In the center is a dim, blue sapphire. It's ringed with a dulled iron band that are cold to the touch. If you raise the locket to your ear, you can hear the swirling sounds of water and the crashing of ocean waves as well as an extraordinarily faint whispering of a song. 

**Properties.**
- This locket is able to store spells. Up to *5 levels worth of spell slots* can be stored inside the locket.
- You can cast the spells inside the locket as if they were prepared, on your spell list, and a spell for your class. They spell uses the spell attack and save of the creature who stored it. 
- To store a spell inside the locket requires an action, and storing the spell consumes your spell slot for that spell as you store it. To be able to store the spell, you must be able to cast the spell.
- If you store a spell inside the locket, and it does not have space for the spell, the *locket immediately shatters* in a 90 ft. radius. Each creature in the radius must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute and take (9d6) psychic damage. A creature that succeeds takes half damage and is not stunned. A stunned creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn. Mystery Effect.
