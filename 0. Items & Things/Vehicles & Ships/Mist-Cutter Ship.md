Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: A ship designed in [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] to sail into [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]

A famous, rare variant of a traditional ship. It features multiple side-by-side masts that are lower as well as triangular sheet sails allowing the ship to tack close to the wind. 

It was built to travel as close as possible to [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]], and while no ship of such a build has emerged from deep travel, a trademark of these ships is that they will sail a shallow amount into the mist of the shrouds to avoid capture.
