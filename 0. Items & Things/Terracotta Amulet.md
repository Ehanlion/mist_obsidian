**Properties.**
- Once per long rest, you can grasp the amulet and invoke its powers.
- When you deal damage to single creature or a group, you can invoke the amulet to coat a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus that you damage with dense, magical mud. That mud slows a creatures movement speed by 10 ft. 
- If the mud takes magical fire damage, the mud immediately hardens, restraining the creature that is coated. The creature can escape by using its action to make a DC 18 Strength (athletics) check to escape.
