# Description and Lore

> [!NOTE] Description
> The Reaver blade, the cleaver of souls, the life ender, the beacon of doom; all names given to Reaver Blades. A fearsome weapon that can deal devastating blows by using its connection to darkness. The sword, in its most basic form, is a great sword, long and two handed. Its blade is a deep black that you can gaze into seemingly forever. The hilt is black-dyed leather, wrapping a sturdy iron hilt adorned with a glowing green gemstone. This blade hungers though. From the edge, it drips a malevolent green and black, the spine of the blade glowing a deep, unsatiated green. As is whirrs and whisks through the air, you can swear it is hungering, thirsting, drinking at the air. 

These blades have some deep lore which can be either told to players or can be recounted from books and novels. Whatever the case, the blades have plenty of stories of the past of which there is no act of good done with it. Worth noting, there are multiple blades as will be explained in the Lore section beneath.

> [!NOTE] Lore of the Reaver Blades
> Reaver blades are special, as they are said to be forged from fragments of the soul of a God, [[The Whispered One]]. Whether or not this bears truth is yet to be determined, however it certainly *seems* likely. Of what little documentation exists, it points to the blades being sentient and decidedly evil. They speak into their users mind, encouraging them to rend to souls from any the blade deems unworthy of life. The blades *hunger and thirst* of their own accord and if a wielder does not do as commanded, the blade will *replace its wielder* with someone who will. 
> 
> The wounds left by these fearsome blades are said never to heal, to eat away at a victim until there is nothing left but a death in darkness. Its devours their senses, their mind, and their soul *slowly but surely*. The blade has never failed to bring a unsuspecting hero to their knees before death. The wound can be staved off, sure, but never once has one struck with the blade lived long enough to see their wound cured. It is innocuous at first, before devouring their body, starting with the senses, then the mind, then the body at long last.
> 
> Only one of these blades is known, it was found by [[Ignel Valis]], a great mage now sadly deceased (from other reasons, not the blade). It was found deep within [[The Labyrinth of Stone]], high in [[The Chromatic Fangs]]. [[Ignel Valis]] locked the blade away, in the hands of a friend who sequestered it away somewhere unknown. However it was hidden, it hides no more for it has escaped its cage and hungers once again. 
# Mechanics
- Cursed weapon, once attuned to, cannot be willingly unattuned to. Wielding any other blade drives the creature to a frenzy, only focusing on reacquiring the blade into their hands. 
- The blade is a *+3 great sword*
- It deals 2d6 slashing damage as base
- **Rend:** recharged upon letting the blade drink and consume an unwilling soul
	- When you hit with an attack with this weapon, you can invoke the blade's power to Rend a target of their soul. The target makes 3 Con saves, versus DC 20.
		- First Save: [[paralyzed]]
		- Second Save: [[blinded]]
		- Third Save: Damage, half from necrotic on success
	- This ability can be used once per day, given the blade has devoured an unwilling soul before use. This can be done at any time, not on the day of Rend being used. 
- **Sentience:** The blade lives
	- The blade is Chaotic Evil
	- It will control an unwilling wielder to do as it bids
	- The blade must drink a soul of an unwilling creature once per day or it will attempt to control its wielder to kill something.
