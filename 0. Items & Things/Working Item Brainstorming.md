**Item Ideas for Magic Items:**
- Main elements for Items:
	- Ability to casts spells innately 
	- Ability to store spell slots
	- Ability to prepare extra spells
	- Improvement to spell save and attack
	- *The more of these it has, the more powerful it is*

What can I add to the [[Nautilus Tablet]]
- it has the ability to prepare additional spells
- So it needs something non-spell related
- maybe need to look at one of the magic item book lists of items

Add to [[Extra Devout Robes]]:
- some divine advantage stuff on checks for fun haha
