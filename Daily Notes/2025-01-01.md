[[Daily Notes]]

**New Years Day Feelings:**
- Today has been okay ish I suppose
- Was down in SD which was great but had a lot of stress about vision like usual
- Felt like there were more floaters in left eye and have had pain that now, at night as I write this, is kind of like an annoying, present aching
	- the floaters are likely always been there?
	- But I just was dialed into noticing it today, so might have felt like more
- That scares the shit out of me cause that Left Eye is the last line of defense against going blind
- So when I feel pain there etc, I get scared

Regardless, todays vibe is:
- still worried about blind spot
- also worried about pain in left eye now + floaters ?
- so kind of meh to be honest

I have been thinking a lot bout new years resolutions:
- One of the ones I wrote down was "learn to live with the reality of my retina/blind-spot situation and be happy"
- I think everyday I worry and worry and worry about it, but let myself live IN that worry
- I keep comparing the vision between the eyes by closing one, opening the other and just looking
- And I feel like (and I've already known this but done nothing), I am doing this to give myself hope that something might be better
	- or worse I do this hoping to find that nothing is worse 
	- which is even more unhealthy, cause that adds stress 
- And the only way to break this is to vow NOT to compare the vision
- Nothing is going to change, certainly not for the better, but the possibility of worsening can't be overlooked
- So I need to learn to do the following things:
	- right when I wake up, do one quick comparison of the vision and use the Amsler Grid to make sure vision is holding steady 
	- during the day after, vow NOT to compare the vision AT ALL, at not time should I be flip-flopping to compare
	- Then at night, do one more compare, again on the Amsler Grid to make sure vision is holding steady
	- I can't change the reality I face, but I can change HOW I face it

**Long story short, for the vision anxiety:**
- Compare check in morning
- Don't compare again until night, where I check it again
- It will not get better, I need to learn fast how to be okay with how it is now
- If you feel a sharp pain, or something worrying, check immediately, but otherwise don't. It is important to be vigilant here
