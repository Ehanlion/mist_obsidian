[[Daily Notes]]

**What's the MOVE**
- I am feeling okay today
- Not excellent, but okay. I am watching a video right now and I feel a little numb to the worry of my vision
- I have been doing my best NOT to split the vision and compare eye to eye today, and maybe that has been helping
- Regardless, I need to get some ideas down for what I want to work on later today!
	- ... since on the 6th of January, I start my second quarter of master's classes!
	- (RF circuit analysis, with Hooman Darabi)

**Ideas to Develop**
- build hag stat blocks and make printable for next session
- build Sahuaguin stat blocks and make printable
	- high priestess
	- baron
	- blade master
	- maybe some other bullshit ??? Idk
- Create fully built templates for printing creature stat blocks
