[[Daily Notes]]

**How am I feeling today?**
- decently good honestly, worried a little bit about next Monday
- Not a day passes without worrying about the vision
- But things, good or bad, will be realized Monday. And I have to be grateful for that no matter what
- I think its time to cut the BS focusing on the eye, and lock in for DND 
- I have a banger session to run on Saturday and I have to lock in for it

**Prep Ideas:**
- Aquan-nation themed items to find in dungeon
- Mining mission themed items to find in dungeon
- Plan out better themed rooms in dungeon
- Block into section, each section has a challenge, a threat, a loot able, and a lore tidbit
