**Today's Vibe**
- MY POS CAR IS BROKEN AGAINT FFS
- Stupid thing keeps fucking breaking when I run e85 on it
- Same misfire error, so I bought new spark plugs for 100$
- Current goal is to:
	- install the ethanol content sensor from Unitronic
	- Install the new sparkplugs with OEM gap
	- Check coilpacks for function as we install sparkplugs
	- NEVER refuel from the Ortega / Antonio station ever again
- Then we should be fine
- It just sucks that the car drives like that this week
- Make sure to pick up the new sparkplugs this week from the store
