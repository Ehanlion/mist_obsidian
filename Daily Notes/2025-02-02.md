**How we feeling**
- 100% of my stress is from midterm on next Saturday
- really feeling a little dead in the water with things
- Studying feels like a long slog and I don't feel like I am going to be well prepared
- I feel like I took this class less seriously than the previous class
- And I feel like it has caught up with me
- Just worried about being able to get down into the metal and thick of things
