[[Daily Notes]]

**How is we feels?**
- Decent to be honest
- Car is fixed all around which is nice
- Work wrapped up nicely at the end of the week which is great
- School is going to ramp up the next 2 weeks leading to midterm and HW1 but that's okay.
- Just need to be diligent and focused on getting lectures done. DND, Games << Master's Work == GF
- Eye stuff is fine. Maybe I will get more worried later but right now, I feel confident about things
- I am working out again too! Trying to combat feeling sedated. First workout felt great, good energy and felt excited
