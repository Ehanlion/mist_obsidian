**How we feeling**
- I hate exams
- Office hours today were not good either 
- And I got stuck on a problem for like 2 hours for no reason which sucked
- Kind of shaken, but hoping for the best

- Now in the morning, I feel okay. I feel like if I do things one step at a time, review the homework and look at the lectures when needed
- And don't let myself be stuck and stop searching for a solution, then I will get to the end of the homework soon.
