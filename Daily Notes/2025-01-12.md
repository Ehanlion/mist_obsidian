**How we feeling chatroom**
- honestly pretty good
- I feel like I need to workout though, because I have been eating like hell and eating too much shit and sugar
- Otherwise, I am resigned to the eye procedure Monday. It will happen. I will find results. I will live with results.
- Done and done. 

No more repressing the fear. I am scared. It will be scary. I will get scary results. I will overcome them. Because I am strong and focused.
