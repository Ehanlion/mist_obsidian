[Celestial Warlock](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock:celestial)

Jay is considering playing a Celestial Warlock
This means that they would need some artsy, celestial-esque patron 

I am thinking their patron is one of [[The Many]]
Not sure who
Needs to be a woman member
Their name as a patron should be an anagram of their name as a member of [[The Many]]
They should be apart of either [[The Wildwoods]] or [[The Starwoods]]
- they can appear to champions as patches of flowers
- trees in the forest
- a woman looking swirl of mist
- They should be of the forest

This can lead into the realization that the entire part of the forest is tied to her latent life force
She died in this forest on [[The Final Day of The Many]] and left her [[Shard]]
her shard can be the conduit of her power and the item of her champion
Probs Jay's character

Maybe the [[Shard]] and herself as a celestial are confused until a champion becomes one with the [[Shard]] allowing her to remember her true self, acting as a powerful lore dump for the party
