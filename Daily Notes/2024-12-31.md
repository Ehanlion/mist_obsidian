[[Daily Notes]]

**Thoughts:**
- Today is new year's eve, and I am not really sure what to think
- This year has held just such an insane amount of shit that happened 
	- good stuff, graduation, work, education, family, new car
	- bad stuff, health, people, yeah, old car
	- REALLY good stuff (Jessica, LOVE her ONG)
	- But also all the hard decisions and health things (yes, I am talking to you eye ...)
- It's just such a cauldron of emotions that I don't really have a good grasp on what or how I am feeling
- This whole year has been so foundational with how much I learned about Ethan
	- given all that has happened with Anxiety
	- with people and stress and health and school
	- with my eye
- And not all that learning is really done, I still have so much that I need to figure out for the new years 
- Tonight is going to be wonderful, but also stressful
- We are going down into SD to see the Gaslamp district and go clubbing for new year's 
- As someone who gets REALLY stressed in clubs I am a little put off? 
- But it is also with Jessica which makes it 100x better so who really knows 

Also the Outer Wild's game soundtrack goes wildly hard for working

**Things to work on:**
- Shit IDK, there are like a million
- just keep adding <#todo> markers to the notes that need to be worked on
- keep adding bad notes to the trimmings folder for old notes
	- need to break back/forward links here too 
- Mushroom civilization apparently ??? but yeah ...
