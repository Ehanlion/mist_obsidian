[[Daily Notes]]

**The vibe today:**
- good! 
- Anxious about my right eye still, worried about that blind spot and losing vision yadda yadda yadda
- Same as usual, but other health related anxiety stuff is going well, it's really just the eye 
- tomorrow I go see Jessica Smith JJS so that will be fun, going to meet her parents
- Worked on my car today, went really well, feels unusual but maybe I am just better at working on it

**Things to work on:**
- Try to re-organize The Many today
- Fiddly with the folder and delete stuff
- Create some new notes 
- Setup some templates for daily notes and for campaign elements too
- Look at some new plugins
