**How I feel today:**
- Mediocre. I am worried about Monday, and the eye procedure to figure out what is going on. 
- I am still scared that, after all my worrying and fear, that they will find that they eye has a permanent blind spot. 
- I expect it to find bad results. It is just that the moment it is realized, then I can't pretend like there is any slim chance for things to change.
- I accept that, in all likeliness, I will have a blind spot forever.
- On Monday, I will start on the journey to living with this. 
- It will be long and arduous. It will suck. It will be the worst anxiety I have had to face, and will have had to deal with.
- But, after it is all said in done, I will pay whatever time I have to beat this. I will beat it. 
- Because, I am Ethan Owen.
- I have beat anxiety before, I have beat the kidney anxiety, I beat the heart anxiety, I beat the friends anxiety, I beat them all.
- This will be the hardest, and I will beat it.
- I will manifest that I have already beat this; past tense.
