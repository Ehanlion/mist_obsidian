[[Daily Notes]]

**How we feeling today Ethan!**
- Pretty decent
- Feel a little self conscious about my weight, but that's what the exercise program is for
- Eventually, with some good eating as well, weight will regulate itself. I just have to be kind to my body in return
- Eye is all good! Not even worrying about it
- Feel good about the Master's stuff
- And stressed about work, feel like I am being a meh engineer these days and want to step my game up
- I feel a lack of focus and a little lost love for the work I get to do, but I think it will all even out
- I just have to be head-down and focused up whenever I am trying to work
