[[Daily Notes]]

**How we feeling:**
- honestly decent, I think tomorrow there will be extensive debugging to do for work things
- but health wise I feel good! 
- I feel heavy, I have been eating bad and have gained around 5 pounds but I am starting to work out and now I feel good
- I don't really worry about the eye. I still compare them but I don't worry about it which is a great progression
- I want to build some cool shit for DND though, specifically some awesome things:
	- Fedorov's legion and some cool Duergar stuff
	- Good magic items for wake
