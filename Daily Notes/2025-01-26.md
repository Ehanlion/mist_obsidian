**How we feeling**
- Honestly, really good, I am writing this part at like 1:00 am so
- thinking about session 27, which I ran yesterday evening
- Wake basically killed like 200 people by lighting a building on fire 
- And it has led to J and Chris talking about Wake and Kelswin
- Kelswin will leave because he believes Wake did that intentionally, just like Kelswin interprets what they were planning to do in Gullhook with The Followers of Alsolace and the large bomb 
- And Wake is considering leaving out of guilt for what they did
- Really loved to hear that J and Chris were actually talking about their characters outside the session.
