[[Daily Notes]]

**We feeling as:**
- Honestly, for the first time in a while I am doing really well
- I had the eye doctor's appointment on Monday and got the following good results
	- The eye will not be getting any worse
	- The eye has no blood flow issues
	- The eye has minimal to no cataracts
	- Both eyes' retina are attached and healthy right now
	- Likely, the blind spot is just a patch of dead pixels. it will not get better or worse
- I am happy with these results and will learn to live in harmony with them

In the meanwhile, I have to get shit TOGETHER for next session right now
