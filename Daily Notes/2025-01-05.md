[[Daily Notes]]

**How We Feeling:**
- After the conversations with Chris, I am glad that he helped and spoke about his concerns
- But it still hurts a little. I can help but feeling anxious about the campaign and my skills as a result of the comments
- I think they are really helpful, but it makes me feel wonky. And quite sad
- It makes me feel like the campaign and my skills are shitty. I know they aren't, but it still shakes the foundations of me a little bit
- Plus I have the start of school tomorrow, and I am behind on some stuff at work and I am stressed over that
- So sources of stress are as follows:
	- feel like a bad GM, even though I am not, just shaken a little bit and doubting myself
	- worried about school starting, my class is highly stressful and very difficulty
	- worried about work, behind on some easy stuff and don't want to face the music, + hard to go back after vacation for so long
- And health stuff is like whatever today?
- The eye sucks, I notice it a lot, but just trying not to let myself do the cross-comparing of them 
- I think, if we get confirmation that it IS permanent, and IS NOT getting worse, then I will be happy
- I can live with things right now, but it will take a very long time to get there
- And it requires the daily discipline to NOT give it attention and learn to live in harmony 

Regardless: 
- You are a good GM, Chris made suggestions not attacks, and you can implement them with some effort
- Let Monday unfold as Monday and work through it
- We will figure out the eye, one step at a time, day after day :)
- It takes strength to be okay with something shitty, you just have to find that strength when you know it can be there. You got this Ethan <3
