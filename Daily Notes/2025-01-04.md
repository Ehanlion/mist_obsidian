[[Daily Notes]]

**What to work section:** 
- Prepping for the dungeon
	- add more loot able items, be it in fights or in rooms to explore
	- every room should have something in theory, be it a small bit of info, lore from [[The Many]], info about Sahuaguin, or items etc. 
	- fireball shouldn't destroy everything
	- tune back the Aquan nation hit points to make combat smoother
	- have less specialized Aquan nation troops in patrols, makes more sense to be predominantly brutes
	- fights should be contained, and less hallway fights to make it more fun (hallway fight still fine if attacking patrol) set-scene-fights are much cooler and much more fun. 
	- tune back reinforcements because spending time + resource to kill and then getting it replaced is VERY feels bad
	- make sure party has time to breathe, it can't be everything piling in at once. unless someone gets reinforcements, it should be self contained. 
	- Have supports be very telegraphed, someone must run from current fight and escape to call for backup
	- make the patrol rotations very transparent
	- any fight that the party has to do must either:
		- give them something cool e.g. literally something
		- or lead to progression, e.g. you have to go through them to get to the next area
- Make Vivian's Journal:
	- Mage Armor
	- Fly
	- Counterspell
	- have them be in journal and thematic
