**How we feeling:**
- Honestly, not too bad!
- first master's lecture went decent, all EM stuff, which is stressful but good to get back into
- Work is going alright. I have a lot of stuff I have to learn I feel? Lot of code to sift through and understand very quickly
- And I am being brought up on a new tool that I have to get sorted soon
- health wise, I am not really sure? I feel like the "do not compare vision" thing is going moderately well, but not superb
- I need to be more disciplined for sure
- I think I am silently worried about the quick procedure Monday for the injection
- It kind of worries me.
- After all this time, it is finally at the point where I get to know what is happening. That's scary to me
- It's like up until this point I have lived with the Schrodinger's blind spot: I don't know if it is permanent or not so I am living with it being both in my mind
- Sometimes I have hope that it isn't permanent. In my heart, I think I know it is. That all the flickering I have been seeing is permanent, that the blind spot is there forever
- I think Monday will come, they will do the injection, and they will find that it is a blood flow issue, and it is a forever thing. 
- And I may not be okay with that then. I might be sad and depressed about it
- But I need to internalize that it has been okay up until now, and it will be okay for as long as possible after
- One day something might happen
- but that day is not today, and it's probably not tomorrow, and likely not the next day
- Live in each day, and appreciate each day. And gradually, things will go from stressful and worrying and scary, to normal 
- But it will take time
- So yeah, I am terrified for Monday. Because I don't want my fears to be right. Even though they will be. And that's scary. Because when the Doc. tells me that its forever, then it really will be forever. No changing it then. And that shall be the day that my life changes forever. And then I will have to learn to live with things as they are
- however hard it may be, I need to live with it <3
