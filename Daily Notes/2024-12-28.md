[[Daily Notes]]

**How I am feeling**
- I suppose these have turned into a self journal of sorts
- I guess that could be healthy, before writing, write about how you feel first
- Watched a video about Marcus Aurelius today, it talked about stoicism 
- I was worrying a lot about my vision today 
- To voice the truest, root fear, I am scared that I may go blind in that eye
- And that if that happened, my other eye would be the last so-to-speak wall between total blindness and me
- And that scares me a lot, but I guess the only thing that I can do is realize "hey, it has not happened yet, and the doctors seem to think you are healthy"
- healthy for everything except the blind spot I suppose
- but that's the only thing left to think: I am okay now and was okay for 22 years before this, I will hopefully be okay for at least the next 22 years as well

**What to work on today?**
- Re-structure The Many
- Try to prune some elements of some sections
- Maybe look at plugins?
