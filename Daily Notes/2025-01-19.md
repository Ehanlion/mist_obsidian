[[Daily Notes]]

**Feeling of the day**
- Honestly pretty good!
- I am more stressed from the master's and work than the eye
- Which sucks, BUT it is a good progression
- Tackling the world is easier than tackling the eye
- And the eye has proven good! I don't worry about it as much

**Things to look at**
- New magic items for druids
- Smaller magic items, I gave them big items, and it's time for small things
