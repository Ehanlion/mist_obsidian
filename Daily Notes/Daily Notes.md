**Conclusion about daily notes:**
I have come to the conclusion that, to make my work better, I need to start by writing. Just writing how I feel. Writing what is bothering me. Writing what I love. Writing the now, before I do. As such, everytime I open the campaign vault in Obsidian, I will first have it open a daily note. This daily note will include, yes, a section about what I want to work on, but also a pulse reading. A blurting section where I can vent my thoughts. Not venting to have a conclusion, not venting to reach a point, just a venting to get things off my head and into a note. Because I struggle SO MUCH with feeling lost in creativity that I think just a couple minutes spent writing my thoughts would improve my mental before writing my campaign.
