Regional Location: [[The South-West Arid Expanse]]
Subsection: None

This bay is formed from the collision of a giant meteor with the coast of [[The South-West Arid Expanse]]. The coast is rippled and distorted from the impact, the sands turned to glassy rock. Islands surrounding the impact were formed from the displacement of the earth. The meteor is still warm, heating the entire bay to a roiling boil.
