# Description:
An intense battle that takes place on stone ruins floating on top of a lake of lava inside the crater of a volcano, maybe inside [[The Commotal Mines]] or the basin of [[The Commotal Caldera]]; both would be good settings for this. This battle would be unique in that it would use a heat system due to the intense nature of the fight.
# Introducing the Heat Meter:
Since this fight takes place in such close proximity to lava, it is only natural that players begin to experience fatigue from the intense heat. Having **fire resistance** or **a natural acclimation to a hot environment** increases the duration between negative effects induced by the heat. If a player has **immunity to fire damage**, they completely subvert the effects of the intense heat.
## The Heat Meter:
During combat each player has a heat meter. This is a measure of how many heat points a player can endure before they are forced to make a constitution saving throw versus a level of exhaustion. 

A player gains a heat point for every action, bonus action, reaction, or movement (beyond your base movement) that your character uses during a round. Additionally, a player always incurs a heat point at the start of their turn.

You can endure a number of heat points before making the constitution saving throws equal to **1 + Constitution Modifier.** If you have fire resistance or a natural acclimation to a hot environment, you add your proficiency bonus on top of this total. 

If at any point your **current** heat points equal to you **maximum** heat points, you instantly make a DC 20 constitution saving throw, on a failure gaining a level of exhaustion. Your heat points immediately reset to zero upon making this saving throw, regardless of a failure or success on the save. 

This ruling will use [[exhaustion (OneD&D)]] rulings alongside it to make exhaustion a little more potent. 

# The Fight:
This fight would take place over heated lava with catwalks and walkways floating atop the lava. It is designed to be brutal, unforgiving and dangerous. There can even be building remnants sticking out of the lava and maybe if they are attacked they can begin to sink.
