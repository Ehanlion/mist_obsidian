# Key Areas to Use
## Salvage Yards
- The group will need to go the Salvage Yards in [[Gullhook]] and specifically talk to Gideon Southmellow, the owner. The group took a mission, detailed in [[Mist Side Quests]].
- **Quest description:** Go into salvage yards, fight "The human ish fishy people" and get paid 100 gp per head.
- **Additional Info:** Group can find book of Gideon that is about mysteries. Group can find children who are getting taken and abducted. 
## Temple Glade
- The group has two reasons to go to The Temple Glade in [[Gullhook]]
	1. [[Wake Tiraus]] killed [[Dmitri Mironov]] and wants to kill [[Igor Larionov]] who is likely there
	2. The group wishes to attend the funeral for [[Dmitri Mironov]] to spy, this quest is detailed in [[Mist Side Quests]]
	3. Optional 3rd reason: Explore the glade to learn more about the gods
## The Forests
- The group will need to go to [[The High Forests]] to solve the riddle I gave them
- Take note, the group will probably look for the moon rats to help them in [[The Serenity Groves]], find them by massive crystals that faintly glow of the mood and of twilight. This should be right on border of [[The Charmed Royalties]] to add the enemy that the rats run from, the stone spider statue, as an encounter.

## Solution

**The First Part:** The riddle's solution spells "V A L E N T I N O" it must be scrawled into 9 squares on the entrance to the compound. 

**The second part:** The party will also need to understand the alignment of each location. This is more obscure. The alignment of the deities is straight forwards but the alignment of the locations is more up-in-the-air. *The alignments are the second of two passcodes to enter the complex.* 

| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     | x   |     |     |     | x   |     |
|     | x   | x   |     | x   | x   |     |     | x   |
| x   |     |     |     |     |     | x   |     |     |

At the bottom of input is Gold Dragon (lawful good) and the top has a Black Dragon (Chaotic Evil). The black dragon is actually [[Agnedelo the Plague-Bringer]], friend of [[Valentino]]. The gold dragon is [[Kragclaw, The Golden Beast]], a normal gold dragon of ancient lore. They won't know this but it is fun to allude to. 
## Entering the Passcode
The passcode must be entered by the entrance to the compound the Sahuaguin are using.
