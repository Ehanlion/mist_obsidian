Campaign: [[Mist Sessions]]
Prior Mission: [[Quest to Begin Mist]]
# Mission Overview:
An onslaught on the town of [[Saddle-Port]], a small fishing village along [[The Whitecliff Plateau]], is imminent according to party intelligence. The group must take time and decide how the will approach this situation: fight, flee, defend, or do something unpredictable. 
#### Timing:
The party arrived back in [[Saddle-Port]] early in the morning on weeks-end. This means they get the entirety of weeks-end to prep as well as a good part of firsts-day. The raid will happen at night, on firsts-day, so they have **roughly two days** to prepare, depending on what they want to do. 
# Outlining the Mission:
This mission begins at [[Saddle-Port]] as a new day starts for the party and ends after the raid has been finished, no matter the state of the party afterwards. 
1. Mission Starts. 
2. Party evaluates options and starts day in town
3. At midday, a storm arrives delivering harsh weather conditions
4. By mid-afternoon, it is dark outside
5. The raid occurs near midnight during the intense weather
6. The raiders leave, either in victory or defeat
7. Party reconciles and evaluate state of town and and NPCs that were abducted. 
8. Mission Ends. 

Obviously, there is a lot of room for deviations here, however it is important that by the end of this mission the raiders have finished attack the village and there are consequences. Assign consequences depending on party actions and outcomes. 
# System to Defend the Town:
An option for the party is to attempt to defend the town by setting up rudimentary defenses. To do so, the group can use **wood units**, **iron units**, **building units**, and **stone units.**
1. **Wood Units:**
	 - Description: wooden planks and beams used for general wooden constructions.
1. **Iron Units:**
	- Description: Iron fragments or pieces used for more durable constructions. 
2. **Stone Units:**
	- Description: Stone blocks or pieces used for foundations of constructions. 
3. **Building Units**:
	- Description: Specialized units of nails, staples, and iron bits for constructions.
### Constructions:
A construction is something created by using very basic units of building blocks in specified amounts. It is an idea of lego-ifying the process of building structures. Each construction requires a certain amount of **building units** and the players only have a certain amount at the disposal. 

A construction has both physical and temporal requirements. Each build needs some amount of building units to construct. It also needs a workforce and a time, denoted as "XP/YH" meaning X amount of People working for Y amount of Hours. 2P/1H means 2 people working 1 hour to complete. 
### Types of Constructions:
Many types of constructions exist. These are just ones I have devised to be created with highly basic supplies: wood, iron, basic building materials, and stone. The constructions are a first draft and, in the mission will be tested. If the system is decently interesting, I will work to transfer it to a full system quite analogous to the potions systems already created. 

**Iron Spiked Barricades:**
A reinforced wooden barricade, with sharp, iron points protruding from the edges of the wooden structure. Causes the most pain for creatures trying to walk through it. 

>  Requirements: 4 Wood Units, 1 Iron Unit, 1P/1H
>  Area: 20 ft by 10 ft
>  Effect: Difficult terrain, creature takes 3d4 piercing damage for every 5 ft moved 
>  Stats: AC 15, 50 hit points

**Hard-Wood Spiked Barricades:**
A strong wooden barricade, with sharpened, wooden stakes set at angles against attackers. A difficult barricade for attacker to penetrate. 

> Requirements: 5 Wood Units, 1P/1H
> Area: 20 ft by 10 ft
> Effect: Difficult terrain, creature takes 1d4 piercing damage for every 5 ft moved
> Stats: AC 15, 45 hit points

**Non-Spiked Barricades:**
A standard wooden barricade. Its crisscrossed structure of wooden framings make it strong and durable against common enemy attacks.

> Requirements: 4 Wood Units, 1P/0.5H
> Area: 20 ft by 10 ft
> Effect: Difficult terrain
> Stats: AC 15, 40 hit points

**Wood and Stone Walls:**
Well-built walls made from a combination of wood with stone reinforcements. Similar to a palisade with a foundation of stone. Provides decent cover for defenders cowering behind the wall.

> Area: 30 ft line, 5 ft wide
> Effect: Provides full cover to those on opposite sides of the wall
> Stats: AC 15, 75 hit points

**Mounted Ballista:**
A sturdy ballista, mounted upon a stone platform for added durability, accuracy, and range. Can be manned by just one person. Launches ballista bolts at enemies moving towards it. A truly frightening defense. Ammunition not included. 

> Requirements: 1 Wood Unit, 2 Stone Units, 2 Iron Units, 1 Building Unit, 4P/4H (SP: proficiency Smiths' tools) 
> Area: Mounted in a 10 ft by 10 ft area

**Rudimentary Ballista:**
A makeshift ballista, made from lesser materials and mounted upon a wooden foundation. Quicker to build and requires less skill but is a tradeoff of power and accuracy. Ammunition not included. 

> Requirements: 1 Wood Unit, 2 Iron Units, 1 Building Unit, 4P/2H
> Area: Stationed in a 10 ft by 10 ft area
> Effect: +6 to hit; Range (80/440); Hit 3d10 Piercing Damages

**Ballista Ammunition:**
Bolts for a ballista. Crafted from sharpened lengths of wood with flights attached to the rear end. Wooden bolts are sufficient for the ballista to function, but not the best.

> Count: Crafts 10 bolts 
> Effect: No additional damage nor effect for ballista

**Iron-Tipped Ballista Ammunition:**
Bolts for a ballista. Crafted from lengths of wood with iron broadheads fastened to the tip. Flights are attached to the ends. Iron-tipped bolts pierce and maul enemies far better than normal bolts. 

> Requirement: 1 Wood Unit, 1 Iron Unit, 1P/1H (SP: Smith's tools)
> Count: Crafts 10 bolts
> Effect: +10 damage, Piercing shot (select another target, in line and within 30 feet. Roll another attack. If it hits, damage dealt to initial target gets dealt to new target).

# Options for the Party:
These are my guesses for how the party will approach this session.
### Bring the Fight to the Raiders:
The party chooses to be the aggressors and wants to find the raiders before they make it to the town. They try to find the raiders by searching along the coast.
### Evacuate Vivian:
The party realizes that [[Vivian Lovejoy]], alongside some miners staying over in the town, will be the targets for the raid. Instead of staying, they take her and the miners and leave town. 
### Defend the Town:
The party realizes that a raid is imminent and attempt to defend the town from the egressing raiders by fortifying the town to defend it.

# Where the Raiders are: 
Layout: [[Smears-burrow]] ------ Cave ---------------------------- [[Saddle-Port]]

On Weeks-end, the raiders are restocking "The Blueberry" at the cave that [[Slug Stoll]] found, just 10 miles south of [[Smears-burrow]]. They will sail to a point off the coast of [[Saddle-Port]] by midday on firsts-day, pretending to fish and concealing their numbers. Once darkness falls on firsts-day, the raiders towards [[Saddle-Port]]. The raid will happen at the 11th hour just before midnight.
# Raid Conduct:
The raid will be according to what is detailed in [[Karak-Ulgurath Town Raid Example]]. There will be a light, infiltration group, backed up by powerful support lurking just off the white cliffs looming over the sea. Support stands on top of the crustacean support creatures.
