# Important Docs for this Session
1. [[Gullhook]] - for town stuff
2. [[The High Forests]] - for forest stuff
3. [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] - for Sahuaguin encounter stuff 
# START HERE:
The party starts in the sea cave with the spire out front, 5 miles from [[Saddle-Port]]. They are 45 miles from [[Smears-burrow]], or about 1 long day in the rough weather. 

I predict that they will go to [[Smears-burrow]] and dick around. Remember that, by lending them the raft, the council asked them to take a delivery up to [[Gullhook]]. The delivery is mostly rarer ice-rocks from cliffs, some rare fish, and gold for trade. 

They will take either the boat or a cart up. Probably sink the boat right as they get into [[Smears-burrow]] to encourage using a cart. I don't want to GM a boat and better to sea coast byway. 
# SENSORY:
- **Rain**: make sure to highlight the feelings of the thunderstorm. Lessen these feelers as the storm abates or as the group moves out of it.
- **Wind**: Gullhook is windy, make sure to describe how the cool breeze ripples through hair and clothes.
- **Town-noise**: Gullhook is VERY busy, it should feel abundant and energetic at every turn.
	- Describe small events as players walk through 
	- Make small noises as players enter shops etc.
	- Use ambient town music to create a sense of chaos and energy
- **Forest Ambience**: Really important, make each area of forest different
	- Untamed Verdant - explosion of color, scent, and texture 
	- Serenity Groves - quiet, easing, relaxing, Feels lazy and laid back
	- Glades of Fate - spooky but good spooky, feels old and regal in a way
	- Charmed Royalties - eeriest, huge webs impede movement, skittering from spiders in distance
	- Widow-Maker's Stands - Deathly quiet, direct foil to Untamed Verdant in every possible way
- **Sahuaguin**: Messy, smells like the sea and rotting fish, crude and barbaric. Guttural throat noises, war cries, and fear tactics in battle

# The Clues I made
**The opening blurb to the riddle is as follows:**
Travel the hidden journey, 
prayers to lost divinities,
of hidden sigil and rights or wrongs,
keyed entry of two is found. 

| Deity/Location              | Clue                            | Alignment |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| [[The Distant Overlook]]    | The point of whale spotting     | Good      |
| [[The Wildmother]]          | The green woman                 | Neutral   |
| [[The Wishing Pond]]        | The wishing pond                | Neutral   |
| [[The Whispered One]]       | The father of death             | Evil      |
| [[The Knowing Mentor]]      | The gray-robed woman            | Neutral   |
| [[The Matron of Ravens]]    | The pale woman                  | Neutral   |
| [[The Revitalizing Spring]] | The revitalizing spring         | Good      |
| [[The Spider Queen]]        | The opulent, alluring woman     | Evil      |
| [[The Bay of Kelp]]         | The churning, green ocean waves | Neutral   |

## What to look for and where they lead
These clues **do not have to be explored in order**.
However, the order listed on the riddle **does matter**.
The players **must** find all 9 locations, discover the runes on each, and assign each location the correct alignment. 
### Finding the Runes
The party will find runes at each clue location. These runes are in *deep speech*, the ancient language of [[The Many]]. The party does not need to understand what the runes say. *The runes are one of the two passcodes to entering the complex.* 

Passcode: V A L E N T I N O (spelled in 16 character cypher I created). 
### Assigning the Alignments
The party will also need to understand the alignment of each location. This is more obscure. The alignment of the deities is straight forwards but the alignment of the locations is more up-in-the-air. *The alignments are the second of two passcodes to enter the complex.* 

| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     | x   |     |     |     | x   |     |
|     | x   | x   |     | x   | x   |     |     | x   |
| x   |     |     |     |     |     | x   |     |     |

At the bottom of input is Gold Dragon (lawful good) and the top has a Black Dragon (Chaotic Evil). The black dragon is actually [[Agnedelo the Plague-Bringer]], friend of [[Valentino]]. The gold dragon is [[Kragclaw, The Golden Beast]], a normal gold dragon of ancient lore. They won't know this but it is fun to allude to. 
# NEXT STEPS: Post-Start and Smears-burrow
Realistically, I expect the players to venture to [[Gullhook]] first. A lot of the elements of the riddle are only understandable if they start to learn more about the pantheon. This requires them to speak to locals and [[Gullhook]] is close to [[The High Forests]].
## Key Things to understand
1. The **Runes** are on each statue and hidden around each location in the riddle. They are easy to find.
2. Make the connection between whale watching and the distant overlook well known, that first clue should be easy and lead the party towards what they have to find. 
3. The [[Gullhook]] NPCs refer to the "deities in the woods," "ancient statues," and strange phenomenon if asked. Religious leaders would know rumors of powerful statues but not of their locations.
4. Local kooks in taverns, or by the cliffs would have tall tales about the other locations in the forests. 
5. Be cryptic - Remember: even the locals have varying tales about the forests, what goes on, what lives there, what the shrines are, and where things are located.
6. **Important:** The locals do know that the Sahuaguin attacks, many were taken, that the Sahuaguin attacked from forest and sea, and that there are Sahuaguin in the forests still. 

Other than that, roleplay heavy in [[Gullhook]] and pivot to using [[The High Forests]] document to run that part of the mission. 
# Running [[Gullhook]]
Okay Gullhook is pretty expansive so ad-lib with stuff there and make it canon later. Just do your best to keep things flowing and split between players whenever possible. 

**Important things to stick to:**
- Raiders were going to attack town, town defenders, huge battle, many dead on both sides, wide spread destruction on side facing [[The High Forests]] and side facing the cliffs / [[The Distant Sea]]. 
- Miners/stone-workers are missing
- Librarians from library are missing
- Many vacancies for jobs/skilled labor, many lost during fights
- General wariness of outsiders, guards at gates check for barnacles growths upon entry
- [[Gullhook]] had between 1-2 thousand residents and they lost around a hundred or so. 
## Side Quests to do and Where They Are:
I am going to break these up by district in [[Gullhook]] and then label them by location in the district.
**Important:** *Every side quest* should include *at least one* bit of info to advance the plot. The side quest will list this.

The most important part about side quest is to make sure to give clues to them solving the riddle:

| Deity/Location              | Clue                            | Alignment |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| [[The Distant Overlook]]    | The point of whale spotting     | Good      |
| [[The Wildmother]]          | The green woman                 | Neutral   |
| [[The Wishing Pond]]        | The wishing pond                | Neutral   |
| [[The Whispered One]]       | The father of death             | Evil      |
| [[The Knowing Mentor]]      | The gray-robed woman            | Neutral   |
| [[The Matron of Ravens]]    | The pale woman                  | Neutral   |
| [[The Revitalizing Spring]] | The revitalizing spring         | Good      |
| [[The Spider Queen]]        | The opulent, alluring woman     | Evil      |
| [[The Bay of Kelp]]         | The churning, green ocean waves | Neutral   |
This is the table. Have people talk about the gods or the locations w.r.t the names of these clues. 
## Running Chugga's
Chugga's is best described as absolute, unquestionable chaos so make sure to run it that way. Legit if you think of anything funny, say that it's happening in the background. Refer to [[Gullhook]] document in the *Chugga's* section for some side quest ideas. 
### Kill Deion
Don't actually kill him obviously, but  do put him close to death. Make sure if he goes down to [[Puck Galewind]], that the other players notice someone running with a hand in a bag, and blood on his clothes. Make sure the players notice Deion going with [[Puck Galewind]] at first too.

Plan:
- [[Puck Galewind]] is in Chugga's.
- He will act VERY friendly towards [[Deion Deus]] and want to catch up.
- Eventually he will want to "show Deion something in my room, come up here"
- [[Puck Galewind]] will then use an overpowered poison dagger to kill Deion if possible:
	- Dagger is purple worm poison, 12d6 additional
	- 3 Con saves versus DC 15 against:
		- Paralysis on fail, silenced on success
		- Full damage on fail, half on success
		- Poisoned on fail, nothing on success
	- Get the con saves in any order players wants to give them randomize order you accept them
- **Why does [[Puck Galewind]] do this?**
	- He wants to become henchman to [[Garrick Blackthorn]]
	- He has been seduced by his promises of power, his talking's of weakness, and his principles
- [[Puck Galewind]] goes after [[Deion Deus]] hand with the insignia of [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] on it to take as proof of kill.
	- Chop off the hand wit insignia
	- Use Deion's own axe cause that would be symbolic and fun 
### Kelswin Meets the Green Order
Introduce a member of the Green Order in [[Elder Thistleton]], He goes by Bristles. 
- He is here to explore [[The High Forests]] and to search for a legendary spring which can heal even the most desperate of conditions (The Revitalizing Spring).
- He has been sent by order, needs to talk to the Hunter's guild. The group are far separated but still get along so so 
- Rumor of something brewing on the coast saw him needing to talk to some old allies 
	- Reference to [[Fedorov's Legion]] getting ready to take over [[The Blue Coat Brigade]]. [[The Dead-Tide Reapers]] are not involved but will help [[Fedorov's Legion]] or [[The Blue Coat Brigade]] depending on offers. 
## Running Temple Glade
These are events that are just happening in the background in [[Gullhook]] to be aware of.
Makes sure to allude to them, especially the Sahuaguin.
### The Cult of Alsolace
Okay I cooked this ages ago and its time for it to appear in [[Gullhook]].
In [[Gullhook]] there is a place called *temple glade*. It is run by [[Tennyson Heralds]].
[[Tennyson Heralds]] leads [[The Following of Alsolace]] who follow their (100% fake) god of [[Alsolace]]
[[Alsolace]] protects from [[Erstorndin]] (also 100% fake). 
Their goals are to: 
- Drug and enslave villagers for [[Livy Revals]] and [[Livy's Livestock]]
- Take as much gold as possible for shrine to [[Alsolace]]
- Push idea that [[Alsolace]] can save people from [[Erstorndin]], who is "attacking poor people"
	- [[Erstorndin]] targets the *Dirge quarters and Hovels* in [[Gullhook]]
	- He is not real, his "followers" are just [[The Following of Alsolace]] dressed in black 
	- This scheme is used to get more gold
- Work with Sahuaguin as *someone* has paid [[Tennyson Heralds]] to do it
	- That someone is [[Ignel Valis]] (Silvan Gile), but no one apart from [[Tennyson Heralds]] know it
	- Some members may, but only saying "The powerful mage from [[Hope Town]] paid us" or some BS

**For the record:**
- The shrines are all totally legit in *temple glade*
- [[Tennyson Heralds]] uses references to the gods like the clues do in the riddle from above since the riddle for this part *was actually based on him because he works for Sahuaguin!*
## The Sahuaguin:
There are Sahuaguin in the town still.
They hide out in *the salvage yards* in the *industry district*
They spy, sneak around and gather info about the town. 
Make people with high perception notice "green walking sea creatures" snaking behind buildings or in a tavern
Trailing them leads down to the salvage yards.
They are:
- Trying to spy and gather information
- capture and take more persons of interest that have arrived via ship into [[The High Forests]] to abduct
