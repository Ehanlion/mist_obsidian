Campaign: [[Mist Sessions]]
Prior Session: [[Quest to Defend Saddle-port]]

> Note: I am going to try a new approach to writing a Mission. This time, instead of fully writing everything out, I am going to leave a lot of openings for improv and instead focus on highlighting general structure, some names of important things, and some key events I want to happen. 

# Recap from Last Time
In [[Quest to Defend Saddle-port]], the party essentially rallied the townsfolk in an effort to ready the town of [[Saddle-Port]] for a defense against raiders from [[Karak-Ulgurath]] (don't know this creature is behind it) and against [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. The session ended with combat started, and [[Wake Tiraus]] delivering an epic strike with the aid of the spell Sky-strike and delivering three lumberjacks into combat as well. [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] was atop the library, perched up there with the giant mounted ballista, and used feather fall to levitate the lumberjacks down. [[Deion Deus]] and [[Slug Stoll]] were inside the Drunken Wyvern tavern with Herbert/Alice and [[Vivian Lovejoy]] ready to defend against intruders. 
### Setting the Stage:
The weather is a **violent thunderstorm** with lightning nearby, strong winds, and sheet rain affecting vision. This makes **talking** and **seeing** difficult. 

# Setting Up Combat + Raid Enemy Types
Refer to the raid examples within [[Karak-Ulgurath Town Raid Example]] for guiding the raid. 

Raiders arrive on the Blueberry, the boat of [[Reggie Brown]]. They will also seek to leave on this boat amidst the thunderstorm. 
### From the Note about the Raids:
![[Karak-Ulgurath Town Raid Example]]
### Barnacle Growths
Remember that the creatures, since they are part of [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], have [[Mutated Barnacle Growths]] on them.

![[Mutated Barnacle Growths]]

### A Note on Destruction
Other towns were subject to *unsuspecting* night raids. This time the raid was predicted, and so a fight is ensuing. 

Destroying [[Saddle-Port]] is a **goal** of this mission. Target the *Drunken Wyvern* tavern, the *Cozy Book Nook (library)*, *Yugo's store*, *the bull pens*, and all *fishing boats*. One or two shots from siege crabs. 

### Relevant NPCs:
These are all the NPCs that the players *recruited* for the defense of [[Saddle-Port]]. The **player column** denotes which player character controls that NPC's stat block. 

The **grouping column** denotes which *group of player characters* and *which location* that NPC begins combat in.

# Raid Focus
Focus all efforts upon capturing [[Vivian Lovejoy]] and the three miners that happened to be staying in the town. Disregard all player characters and other character and focus entirely on capturing these key targets. 

__ __
# Conducting Combat
Players will control the NPCs of the town, except for very strong NPCs and key *target* NPCs (like [[Vivian Lovejoy]], the miners can be controlled it's fine). 
### Grouping NPCs
Group **NPC turns** directly *after* the player's turn that control them. Group **enemies** by type and from each group. Each group has key enemies like *priestesses* and *barons* as well as brutes. Group the brutes, and leave the others. **End up with 3 entities in combat per enemy group**.
##### Sahuaguin Groupings
Each group starts with 5 Sahuaguin as one enemy.
- Multiply the hitpoints by 5, so **80 hit points**
- The group make **3 multi-attacks per turn**
- The group loses a multi-attack once it hits **55 hitpoints**, and again at **30 hit points**
### Encouraging NPCs
Players are in control of NPCs that they inspired.
Through the *player's* actions, they can inspire those that follow them.
If a player can attack, move, or act in a way that can relate to the NPC that follows them, that NPC (when they take their turn) get to **add 1d4 to any ability check, save or attack roll.**

Refer to an **NPC's religion**, **line of work**, or **personality** to inspire them. 
Make sure to reference [[The Prime Deities]] that NPC's follow or the NPC's **occupation.**
## Environment
Make sure to describe weather and setting well.
Encourage players to think creatively. 
###### Weather Factors
The raid takes place at night, during a thunderstorm. Use **heavy wind**, **lightning strikes**, and **heavy rain** to add *danger*, and importantly, *obscure vision*. 

1. **Lightning:** Deals 1d12 lightning damage to 3 targets. Thunder that follows makes talking to anyone 15 ft away or more impossible.
2. **Heavy Wind:** Makes moving in the direction of the wind count as difficult terrain and moving away from the wind count as double speed. Other directions not impacted.
3. **Heavy Rain Sheets:** [[heavily obscured]] condition used, all attacks made at disadvantage. Cannot see beyond 5 ft.  

Rotate between all 3 options each round on *initiative count 20.*
###### Interactable Items
1. **Barrels of Fish Oil:** There are **barrels of fish oil** near combat. These can be pushed *with a DC 10 athletics check*.
2. **Fishing Poles:** There are **tall metal fishing rods** that can be used to direct lightning strikes. These require no check to interact with
3. **Potions:** The group has a *potion of heroism*, a *potion of fire breath*, and a *lesser mana potion*. These are found in [[Potions with Alchemist's Supplies]] note document. 

## Offers to Escape Death
Some of the player characters will die in this combat here are ways they can get out of it.
1. [[Yugo Stolid]]: Devil, offers contract. "When time comes to pay the toll you pay it, no matter the cost." Can escape death only if they *sign the contract with [[Yugo Stolid]],* no questions asked. 

__ __
# Post-Combat
The village will be mostly destroyed, the fleet of ships on fire and in ruins, and the townsfolk either injured or dead in vast amounts. 

Make sure all ships are burned to ensure there is no way to chase the raiders.

Hopefully [[Vivian Lovejoy]] and the three miners will be captured by [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]]. 

Make sure [[Deion Deus]] returns the **+3 Phrax-weapon** to [[Yugo Stolid]], otherwise the contract will rend [[Deion Deus]]'s soul forfeit.

[[Yugo Stolid]] will leave to go to [[The Deep Woods]] to reconvene with some "friends."
