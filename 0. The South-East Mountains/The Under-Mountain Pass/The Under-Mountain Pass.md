This is the spookiest, most unnerving, and (deceptively) the most dangerous of the paths through [[The South-East Mountains]]. It is dark and spooky. It takes travelers through hallucinogenic pockets, underwater sections, and intense mental warfare. It is the least appealing choice when compare to the temperate but brutal [[The Red-Stone Pass]] and the freakishly frosty winds of [[The Cold Road]].
