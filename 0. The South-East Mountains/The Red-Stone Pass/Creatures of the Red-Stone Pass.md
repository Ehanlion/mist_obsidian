[[The Red-Stone Pass]] has many enemies. It passes directly through the middle of the mountains and as such, strange creatures from the high mountains prey upon the pass for its numerous creatures that walk its red stones.

[[Garrick Blackthorn]] and [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] protect those who pay them tribute from the numerous horror that the mountains hold. The Marauder make no attempt to conceal the horrors, leaving killed creature's heads outside the main front entrance to the pass to scare those who wish to travel it into paying more.
