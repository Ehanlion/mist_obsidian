# Character Description:
*Garrick doesn't take any bull shit. He is a no-nonsense, straight forward man. And he is a seasoned killer. He is tall, nearly 7 feet and that's the least imposing thing about him. He has one eye, the other shrouded by a massive black scar from some battle long ago. He has a broad nose and a wide face, joined to his body by the widest neck you can imagine. He wears a black and red draped cloak with a silver first in the middle of the back. He swings a wicked black, glinting great-axe as if it were a toy. His skin is painted in red tattoos depicting the deaths of his victims; that is, what skin you can see, the rest of him is covered in black, glinting plate armor.*
### Garrick's Past:
Garrick was never good aligned. Don't make that mistake. He has been, and will always been Chaotic Evil. However he is highly manipulative and deeply persuasive. Garrick convinced [[Ignel Valis]] to venture into [[The Dark Woods]] to attack [[Fenrix the Plague-Bringer]]. Garrick wanted the soul of Fenrix for his own power and [[Ignel Valis]] wanted a shard from the hoard of Fenrix. Their missions aligned so they worked together. All their soldiers were killed, Ignel walked away with the shard, and Garrick walked away with the soul of Fenrix. The parted ways on fair terms, Ignel had his death faked and [[The Greatest of the Great]] written to commemorate his life. Garrick joined [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] and quickly asserted dominance over their ranks.

A note about Garrick: Use the Black Dragon Stat block, replace the claw / bite attacks with great-axe attacks. He should have legendary resistances, high AC, and legendary actions. Tinker with his mental stats. He should have high charisma (natural speaker and leader), high intelligence (smart in combat and tactical), medium wisdom (less knowledgeable). As for physical stats, he should have insane strength (from belt of giant strength), insane constitution, and mediocre dexterity (he is heavy and not super agile, but he is fast).

**Giant's Belt:**
Garrick wears the Belt of Cloud Giant Strength (Strength 27). He got it from killing a cloud elemental (duh) and will die before giving it up. 

**Empowered Breath Weapon:**
Garrick has the breath weapon of a Young Black Dragon, making him a brutal foe in combat. 

[[Turtle Stance]], Master-Level:
Garrick has learned the turtle stance. He once passed through [[The Green Order]] in his much younger days under a disguise. He learned from [[Mona Shadowbloom]], a young student under the master of those days. She left to travel with Garrick and eventually died by his side. He was only there searching for the dragon, [[Fenrix the Plague-Bringer]] and knowledge about it of which he was successful.
