Grumbar is an ancient deity, resident of [[The South-East Mountains]]. He is an ancient god who is the elemental embodiment of earth and stone.

He had few worshippers to start but grew significantly in power with the gathering of mountain beings. 
# Grumbar's Motives
He is known as a cold god; one shrouded in 
He protects with fury the unspoiled wealth of the earth and hates when it is mined or tampered with.
He opposes change with all his might and his followers do too.
He, and his followers, oppose the creation of new landmarks on and below the earth. 
# The Sleeping of Grumbar
Shrines, whispering in dreams, and a faint call draw those who wander the mountains to the following of Grumbar. However, the god himself slumbers; his essence weak and scattered across the mountains. His followers seek to rebuild his soul so that he can awaken once more to lead them. 
# Enemies of Grumbar
Grumbar hates [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] for their defiling of the great mountains and the creation of [[The Blood-Stone Pass]]. Grumbar sees it as an atrocity and an abomination and he sends his followers to destroy what has been built. 
# The True Nature of Grumbar:
Grumbar is a very unique god when it comes to examining the pantheon of Mist. Grumbar does not fit into either [[The Prime Deities]] or [[The Betrayer Gods]] so this begs the questions of 'why is Grumbar on Mist.' The following is the legend of Grumbar:

>Before [[The Many]] arrived on Mist, Mist was a normal island with normal people living on it. Those people worshipped the standard pantheon of Gods (not [[The Prime Deities]] nor [[The Betrayer Gods]]). In ancient times, Grumbar, in a visit to Mist, was put to sleep deep within the mountains. It was said that these adventurers were so powerful and so wise that they could see the future. In that future, Grumbar would cause destruction unopposed by the other Gods (This references the future after [[The Many]] and the departure of the other original Gods of Mist). Grumbar soul was sealed deep within an ancient Labyrinth that was built by [[The Followers of Grumbar]] (the original ones) and the labyrinth was scrambled and the memory of how to navigate it was erased from the minds of [[The Followers of Grumbar]].

Grumbar is the only God that has a physical presence on Mist still because his soul was sealed within [[The Labyrinth of Stone]] **before** [[The Many]] built [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] and enforced [[The Divine Barrier]], banning Gods from setting foot on Mist. If Grumbar is raised he can and will "cause destruction unopposed by the other Gods" because there will be no god that can physically stop him.
