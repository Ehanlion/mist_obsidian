Regional location: [[The South-East Mountains]]
Subsection: [[The Blood-Stone Pass]] and [[The Cold Road]]

The followers of Grumbar are an aggressive sect of followers of the old mountain god named [[Grumbar]]. They follow in his belief that all who defile the sanctity of the mountains deserve to be destroyed. As such they have many enemies in the mountain passes.
# What they look like
As they take on aspects of [[Grumbar]] themselves, his followers become aspects of him. Their limbs become corrupted by sour mud, their forms grow rocky and hard, and their movements seem to become sluggish and melding to the earth. They have growths on them that look like bulging and sharp stones and crystals. 
### The Mechanics of this:
Any follow of Grumbar gains the following benefit and detriments to their abilities:
1. **One with stone:** The creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage.
2. **Walk through stone:** Difficult terrain caused by non-living substances does not impose disadvantage to this creature. 
3. **Crystalline impact:** A creature with crystal growths can use them to empower attacks. A creature can exert each crystal 3 times per long rest, with each crystal empowering an attack for 1d8 extra force damage. Destroying those crystals will deal brutal damage to the target though; a crystal has an AC of 22 and can be shattered, dealing 6d8 force damage to the target.
4. **Murmurs of Grumbar:** A target following Grumbar hears murmurings from Grumbar, driving them to 'rebuild him in glory.'
