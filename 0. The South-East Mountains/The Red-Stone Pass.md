This is the pass through the mountains that [[Garrick Blackthorn]], leader of [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] have dominion over. In the middle sits [[The Bastion of Blood]], the stronghold of the Marauders. It is the medium path through the mountains; it avoids the fearful spawnings of the under-mountain and the gales and fierce weather of the high mountains.
