Regional location: [[The South-East Mountains]]
Subsection:

This is the highest, most treacherous (at least physically) of the passes through [[The South-East Mountains]]. It is higher up, far higher up, than [[The Blood-Stone Pass]] and is the essential opposite to [[The Under-Mountain Pass]] in terms of the challenges one faces along both routes.
