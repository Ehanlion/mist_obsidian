Regional location: [[The South-East Mountains]]
Subsection: Passes over [[Slumbering Mount]]

This is the pass through the mountains that [[Garrick Blackthorn]], leader of [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] have dominion over. In the middle sits [[The Bastion of Blood]], the stronghold of the Marauders. It is the medium path through the mountains; it avoids the fearful spawns of [[The Under-Mountain Pass]] the gales and fierce weather of [[The Cold Road]].
