Regional location: [[The South-East Mountains]]
Subsection: [[The Blood-Stone Pass]] 
# Cost for Protection
The marauders are sneaky about how they offer protection. Groups can offer as much as they want. However, at the entrances to [[The Blood-Stone Pass]], there are dismembered corpses of horrific beings from the mountains, incentive to pay more. Furthermore, if multiple groups are attacked at the same time, and the marauders know one paid more, the other groups will be left to fend for their own. If the members of those groups are killed, then the Marauders take the goods for themselves.

# Barbaric yet appealing
It is quick to assume that this method is barbaric and would drive customers away from using [[The Blood-Stone Pass]] but this is not true. [[The Cold Road]] has weather so treacherous that in bad season, almost half of all those who travel it die. In decent weather, it's still dangerous. 

#### A barbaric branding:
All members of the iron-fist marauders are tattooed with [[Markings of the Blood-Stone Pass]].
