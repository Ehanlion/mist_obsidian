These paths are the only way through the range of [[Solemn's Peaks]], the largest and only range of true, continuous mountains on the island of Mist.

The first pass is controlled by [[The Tideblade Corsairs]]. It is the closest to the sea, and at numerous points along its path, it treads along a cliff side, allowing those who travel it to see wavey, frothy harbors below where small raiding ships are anchored.

The second pass is controlled by [[The Summit Syndicate]]. Is it the highest of the passes, and at one point it crests one of the mountains in the range of [[Solemn's Peaks]]. It is cold and icy, not a journey for the queasy. It is also the most difficult of the passes to trek due to its intense elevation.
