# True Nature
The seat of stone, alongside [[The Blackwood Ring]] are actually remanent of [[The Final Day of The Many]]. When [[Faustus]] used modify memory through [[The Aether-Veil Projector]], he wiped the minds of all on the island, including himself. The original King of The Seat of Stone was actually [[Faustus]] and [[The Blackwood Ring]] (really the members of [[The Scintillating Order]] who attacked [[The Many]]) were his close advisors. The group, headed by [[Faustus]] and forgetting of their bitter hatred, created [[Gandoras City]] as a strong point on the islands thousands of years ago. 

Descendant Kings and Queens who sit on the Seat of Stone, ruling [[Gandoras City]], are actually direct descendant of [[Faustus]], the leader of [[The Many]]. 

TL;DR: The original and first King of [[Gandoras City]] started the lineage of [[The Seat of Stone]] with the first King being [[Faustus]]. His closest advisors and supporters were [[The Blackwood Ring]], the original members of [[The Scintillating Order]] sent to kill [[The Many]] and [[Faustus]]. 
# Description:
The Seat of Stone has ruled Gandoras City for 900 years. They are strict, honest, and well liked. 
# The Throne of Stone:
in the Hall of Kings, the main chamber of [[Gandoras City]]'s Ruling Halls, lies the great Throne of Stone. It is a massive throne built from perfectly white stone, mined from the tall, white cliffs of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. It has wide arms, a tall base, and a very tall back with ornate carvings. In the center of the tall back rests a glowing and glittering white gem. **This Gem is actually one of the eight [[Shards]] and is the original Key held by [[Faustus]] since he was the first king of [[Gandoras City]].** (People know the name of the first King as [[Faustus]] but nothing about the connection to [[The Many]]). 
#### The Divine Right to Rule:
The Gem is said to give [[The Seat of Stone]] the divine right to rule [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] and [[Gandoras City]]. It is said that it imbues the King with a powerful energy. However it is told that a curse will be bestowed upon any one that tries to remove the gem or touches is. Simply approaching the gem and miming to touch it is enough to send one into a madness.

This madness happens because the Gem bestows its memory (being one of the [[Shards]]) to the offender and this causes a rush of non-sensical and insane feeling memories to whoever tries to contact it.
