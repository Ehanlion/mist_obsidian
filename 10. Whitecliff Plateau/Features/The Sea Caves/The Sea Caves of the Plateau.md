# What are the sea caves:
The sea caves are located in the [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. General terms, each sea cave is a massive, inland 'lake' of salt-water. Each has a way of connecting to the sea, be it from underground sea-tunnels, large open arches sailable from sea to sea cave, and so on. They are tidal and their water levels are equal to those of the ocean as a result. 

These sea caves allow people to fish in them rather than the sea and each offers a very wide variety of different ecosystems compared to each other and the sea.
#### Naming the Sea Caves:
Although all are 'technically' sea caves, they are often referred to with different names and conventions -- lagoon, grotto, caverns, the list goes on. 
# The Big Three:
The first sea cave is [[Shimmer Mist Lagoon]], and it is considered the friendliest, most placid, and easiest sea-cave to fish in.

The second sea cave is [[The Echoing Grotto]], and it is considered the most magical, and enchanting of the three caves. 

The third sea cave is [[The Sunken Caverns]], and it is considered to be the most dangerous, deadly, dark, and fearsome location on the entirety of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]].
