# Description
A small, innocuous pond rests amidst a calm grove. No birds tweet, nor frogs croak, nor animals murmur in this calming glen. In the center rests a pool of shimmering, iridescent blue. The waters swirl with enchantment. It does not look deep, but looking closer, this pool has no bottom. Swimming down into the depths, as some have tried, only finds you swimming back up to the surface. Coins and offerings and sprinkled around the edges of the pool.

You notice that, as a coin slides from the edge of the pool into its shimmering waters, that the coin dissolves into a shimmering silt and mixes with the waters. 
# Mechanics
**Making an Offering to the Pond:** A player may make an offering to the pond at any point. They can offer anything they see as valuable, but must offer at least some donation. It can be of emotional value, monetary value, or distinct rarity. The more something matters, the better chance of getting something good to happen. Directly before or directly after tossing something into the pond a creature can utter a wish, either in their mind or out loud. 

This interaction is based off *of rolling d6's*, the *face value* rolled on each die, and *the number of those faces* rolled. In general *1's or 2's* can possibly lead to something contrary to the wish occurring while *5's and 6's* can possibly lead to something in line with the creature's wish. 

**Evaluating how many dies to roll:** The more valuable the item used as sacrifice for the wish, the more dice a player gets to roll. A bare minimum offering grants 3 dice, the minimum possible. A moderate offering grants 4, a substantial offering grants 5, and a supreme offer grants 6. *For an event to occur* you must roll *3 or more of the same face.* If they are 1's or 2's, something contrary to the wish happens but if they are 5's or 6's the wish comes true (possibly in full or possibly in part). 

**A Double-Edged Blade:** This interaction is *designed to work both for and against a player.* It is gambling. The more you offer, the greater chances of something good happening but the chances of something equally bad happening rise to meet it. A player has an equal chance, at all times, of a good or bad outcome occurring. 

**No More Using the Pool:** Once you are successful in getting a wish granted, the pool ceases to obey you and any offering you make simply float on the surface. This is contrary to accepted offering sinking below the water and dissolving. 
# Folk Lore
In towns like [[Gullhook]], [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]], or [[Trawlrock]] there are tales of those, down on their luck, that braved [[The High Forests]], searching for a pond in ancient lore that was said to favor the lucky. One man, after his beloved vessel was savaged by the sea, went in search of the pool. When he returned, he sailed his stricken vessel into the sea with confidence and it floated, good as new. Another though, sought out the pool in desperation, for his infant child was deathly ill. He travelled for long nights, found the pond and returned, but when he arrived, his child was dead to plague, alongside his wife.
