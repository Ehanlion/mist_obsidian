Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: Forest section in [[The High Forests]]

> [!NOTE] Description
> The forest associated with [[The Whispered One]]. Do not go here. No one would dare enter this forest. Death awaits any who walk through the dark thickets here. Heavy mist sits stagnant in the trees here, the sun fears to shine, and adventurers go mad, or if their lucky, they find death here. An adventurer once went in to seek an artifact of resurrection; he never returned. 

**Creatures:**
- Sahuaguin patrol this region of the forest since it is the most westerly. 
- Since this region is the closest to [[The Bay of Kelp]], it is the area where the Sahuaguin are most potent.
