Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: Forest section in [[The High Forests]]


> [!NOTE] Description
> The forest associated with [[The Spider Queen]]. Beware the subtle whispers, kind compliments, and invoking whispers in your ears - for these forests run rampant with conniving, telepathic spiders. Large rocks spread out the thick, tall trees here. Dense webs connect trees to trees, scattering the sunlight that peeks through. Many a great warrior have gone missing in these woods, and for good reason. It is said that at its heart, these woods protect a powerful secret and that a great evil runs amuck amidst the trees. 

**The Forest Has Eyes:**
The more you walk in this forest the more that you seem to be watched. The Stone Spider golem can see through the eyes of any spider in the forest and it stalks you. 

**Creatures:**
- Sahuaguin patrol this region of the forest since it is the most westerly. 
- [Phase Spiders](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/phase-spider) - Depict them *trying* to phase shift but failing because of the planar disconnect.
- [Stone Statue Spider](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/prism-spider) - Re-skin prism spider as statue spider. Needs to be baited onto pedestal.
