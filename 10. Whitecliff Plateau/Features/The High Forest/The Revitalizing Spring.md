# Description
[[The Revitalizing Spring]] is a collection of warm, soothing hot springs. They have a faint sulphiric smell and their waters are naturally warm. The waters are a vibrant blue; some pools are shallow and some are deep enough to dive in. Forest foliage grows at their edges, casting soft shade over the pools. The waters cascade down from a natural hot spring and bubbles off into a small stream that flows to [[The Echoing Grotto]]. 
# Mechanic
If you take a short rest in the pools, you **gain 3 hit die + Con mod for each** of temporary hit points. You are slowly cured of ailments. If you rest in the pools for 24 hours, you are cured of a disease or condition. Long lasting wounds clear and heal. Don't stay too long or the minerals in the waters will begin to make you sick. 
# Folk Lore
Townsfolk of [[Gullhook]], [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]], and [[Trawlrock]] (the closest towns to [[The High Forests]] and [[The Echoing Grotto]]), tell stories of a healing pond nestled deep in [[The High Forests]] that healers lead sick villagers to out of desperation. Sometimes the forest claims them for its own; sometimes it is said that the forest forgive those who enter it and allow them to find the spring to heal at.
