![[Creating Karak-Ulgurath]]

**Killing [[Karak-Ulgurath]]**
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is the patron of all [[The Aquan Nations]] and enrages them in his death
- [[The Aquan Nations]] will not stop their conquest, [[Karak-Ulgurath]] simply proclaims a new prophecy and does not need to stick around to see it to fruition
	- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] merely serves as a inspirational symbol
	- If it dies, there is less morale in [[The Aquan Nations]] but they have been gifted a prophecy
	- They will follow this prophecy like scripture until absolute failure
- However, [[Karak-Ulgurath]] IS a perfect siege weapon to be used against [[Gandoras City]] when the time is right, as intended by [[Silvan Gile]] and [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]. If it is killed, this will *heavily delay* any plans to conquer [[Gandoras City]], [[The Seat of Stone]], and [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. 

**Mechanics**
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] functions as *two* creatures at once:
	1. [[Karak-Ulgurath]] itself, the crab form, leveraging massive strength and divine powers of [[The Stormlord]], granted from the shrine
	2. [[Silvan Gile]] acting through the [[Master Mind Rock]] bound to its carapace, providing spellcasting and controlling the librarians 
- Both will take turns on their own in combat
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] will just destroy whatever hits it last
- [[Silvan Gile]] will target spellcasters OR command the librarians to flee towards a teleportation circle or something
