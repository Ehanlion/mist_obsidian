**Creating [[Karak-Ulgurath]]**
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is an *aspect* of [[The Stormlord]]
- Powers are derived from a transmuted variant of a [[Shrines of The Many]]
	- This is a shrines containing replicated powers of [[The Stormlord]]
	- [[Silvan Gile]] and [[Voramas]], Archdevil of [[The Umbral Cabal]], crafted powerful enchantments that harness the magic of this [[Shrines of The Many]]
	- The [[Shrines of The Many]] grants [[Karak-Ulgurath]] powers of the storm, the sea, and the cold
	- The enchantments from [[Voramas]] grant [[Karak-Ulgurath]] the Infernal creature type and innate spellcasting of a lesser devil
	- The enchantments from [[Silvan Gile]] grant [[Karak-Ulgurath]] innate spellcasting of a wizard, the mental acuity of [[Silvan Gile]] himself, and telepathy with [[Silvan Gile]]
	- Furthermore, [[Silvan Gile]] melded a [[Master Mind Rock]] with [[Karak-Ulgurath]], allowing [[Karak-Ulgurath]] to create and control crabs with [[Mind Rock]]s embedded within the carapace. 
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] was created as a peace offering for [[The Aquan Nations]]
- By bringing about the herald and aspect of [[The Stormlord]] early, this brokered a peace between [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[The Aquan Nations]]
- It was prophesized that every 500 years, an aspect of [[The Stormlord]] would rise to proclaim a new prophecy and future for all [[The Aquan Nations]] for the next 500 years
- This time, when raised, the prophecy (forced by [[Fedorov's Legion]]) was that [[The Aquan Nations]] would rise to conquer [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] as their own territory, flooding the lands and turning them into a marshland to live in.
