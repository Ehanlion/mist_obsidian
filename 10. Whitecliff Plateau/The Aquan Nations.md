Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: Coalition of Sahuaguin, Triton, and Chitinous factions in the [[The Harmonious Sea]] and [[The Distant Sea]]

**Description**
A large, allied coalition of sea-creature nations, allied under the newly forged banned of [[The Aquan Nations]]. This group was harmonized by [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]]. They are unified around the coming of their great god, [[The Stormlord]], in his new form of a giant crab known as [[Karak-Ulgurath]]. 

**Main Goals**
[[Fedorov's Legion]] is maintaining [[Karak-Ulgurath]] as the divine coming of [[The Stormlord]], as prophesized by [[The Aquan Nations]]. They have helped manifested [[Karak-Ulgurath]] early as a favor for [[The Aquan Nations]], with the leadership of Archwizard [[Silvan Gile]] and the divine expertise of [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]]. 
- [[The Aquan Nations]] are being inspired that, with [[Karak-Ulgurath]] they will overthrow the surface dwellers of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]].
- If [[Karak-Ulgurath]] perishes, it is their sign to avenge the death of the divine aspect, and destroy [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] as recompence 
- [[Fedorov's Legion]] is posing as the stewards of [[Karak-Ulgurath]], and have helped raise it as a gift to [[The Aquan Nations]] in exchange for their loyalty 
- The concrete goals are as follows:
	- amass weapons and troops first
	- Plan small strikes of terror against all towns on [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
	- Arrange a series of larger strikes, forcing the attention of [[Gandoras City]] and [[The Seat of Stone]]
	- When they launch a defense, the main forces will arrange to occupy [[King Gillian's Channel]] as a staging ground for a joint invasion of [[Gandoras City]].
	- This invasion will be enforced by a land force of [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[The Iron-fist Marauders]], alongside armies of the undead and the dragons
