Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: Missing from [[Smears-burrow]]
# Description:
Reggie, to his friends known as R.B., is an average fisherman. He has a tangled mop of hair, often with tangles of seaweed in it. He has a portly belly and notably, always wears a nice yellow overcoat while he is out fishing.
# Location:
Reggie lives in [[Smears-burrow]] and is a relatively well liked and notable fisherman there. 

He captains a single fishing vessel by the names of *The Blueberry*. It is a petite vessel, but one that is more than capable of storing large amounts of cargo if necessary. It is about 45 feet long and 15 feet wide with a deep keel, capable of deep-sea fishing journeys. 
# Man Missing:
Reggie has recently gone missing from [[Smears-burrow]]. He was last reported leaving on his fishing boat and sailing along the coast to fish in the shallows. Importantly, it is known that he is NOT missing from a raid that happened at [[Smears-burrow]] because he went missing BEFORE the raid that happened. 

More details about where his body can be found are contained with the 'Sad fisherman' hook of [[Quest to Begin Mist]].
