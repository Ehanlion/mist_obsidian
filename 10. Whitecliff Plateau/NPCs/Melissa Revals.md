# Backstory
10 years ago, Melissa ran from her childhood home of [[Livy's Livestock]]. This place is an underground slave ring operating out of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. She was mistreated and forced to help with the slaving for fear of being punished and beat. This fueled her hatred. One day she ran out at night, escaping with a dozen children younger than herself. Her, alongside the children she helped to escape, started [[The Forest Freaks]] in [[The High Forests]].

She wanted to live a life of adventure while helping people so, in a fashion similar to robin hood, she and her members of [[The Forest Freaks]] raided convoys carrying goods. They targeted rarities like spices, rare foods, magic items and artifacts, and treasury shipments. She used these shipments to strengthen her brigand of children and continue to do as much good as she can.

Her end goal has and always will be to *defeat her mother, Livy, and stop the slave ring once and for all.* However, she knows from working there that the ring has powerful backers in [[Hope Town]] like [[Fedorov's Legion]] and specifically, [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] who has a personal stake in the business, using the trafficked slaves as entertainment in a gladiatorial arena known as [[Hugo's Arena]] in [[Hope Town]].
