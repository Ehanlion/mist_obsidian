Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: A growing cult spreading across towns. Largest foothold in [[Gullhook]]. 
# The followers of Alsolace:
Groups come to villages as travelling ministers of the good god [[Alsolace]]. They do not preach desperately for those in the village to join their order. They do not force anyone to join in the hands of [[Alsolace]], the golden light. No, they preach that [[Alsolace]] is a loving and accepting god; [[Alsolace]] accepts anyone for any of their beliefs and for any of their beliefs in another God. 

Stronger orders even take over the temples of towns, supplanting the worship of [[The Prime Deities]] and a fear of [[The Betrayer Gods]] with a love for [[Alsolace]] and fear for the dark god [[Erstorndin]]. 
# Members of the Following and Stat Block Ideas
## Enlightened Ones
The upper echelon of the followers. They are powerful and exalted, some even wielding magic of their own. Although of those that do, it is important to know that they *are clerics* and derive their power from [[The Betrayer Gods]] and not one of [[The Prime Deities]] and certainly not [[Alsolace]]. There are only a handful of Enlightened Ones in the order and they wear Dark Gold Robes as a sign of their power. They know the true nature of [[Alsolace]] as a front for [[The Lord of the Hells]] and that [[Erstorndin]] is simply fake altogether. 
## Devotees
Generally stronger. They act as pseudo-enforcers. They wear moderate armor and wield weapons with knowledge and practice. These are by no means threatening enemies, but their numbers compensate for their individual lacking. They hold no magic, which is why they do not understand the nature of [[Alsolace]] nor [[Erstorndin]] but believe in the message of [[Tennyson Heralds]] over everything else. 
## Followers
Followers are traditional clergy members who are devout to [[Alsolace]] without an incline of the true nature of [[Alsolace]] nor [[Erstorndin]]. They wear simple white and gold-lined robes and and just basic commoners. No special stats or anything. Low hit points, easy to dispatch. 
## A Secret Power
[[Tennyson Heralds]] draws his power from worship of [[The Lord of the Hells]], as do the Exalted of the Following. The rest of the order are mostly ignorant to the true nature of [[Alsolace]] although they are certainly privy to the harsh demeanor of [[Tennyson Heralds]]. 
# Shrines to Alsolace:
When members of the followers come to a village, they will eventually want to establish a shine to [[Alsolace]] somewhere in the village. Offering can be left to the shrine in the form of gold, since it is from volumes of gold that [[Alsolace]] draws his strength. 

**True nature of the shrines:**
The Shrines 'gold' donations and tributes are actually taken by the cult and set aside in bag to later be taken. The offerings and the statue itself are actually just wood coated in golden foil in order to give the appearance of being made from gold. 
# Control and Expansion
The Following takes a very simply approach to controlling villages. They use a current tragedy or an event that inspires fear and blames the (false) god [[Erstorndin]] for the calamity. Then they use [[Alsolace]] as "the golden god" and secretly stop happenings as more gold gets donated. This can take form in secret combat missions to battle a threat or ceasing an event they are causing in the village (like abductions). They gather the gold of the town, and use it to fund future expansion.
