# Description:
Dmitri is a broad, hefty orc, too stout for his own race. He does not speak much. He has a mop of dark, ratty hair that drifts over his eyes. He is hunched and gnarled with his nose bent and broken in too many places. He has many tattoos on his face of prayers to the seas for safety. 
# Location:
[[Dmitri Mironov]] is headed to [[The Sunken Caverns]] in [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. He has travelled far across the island with the companionship of [[Igor Larionov]]. 

**Slave Trader:**
He is also helping [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Following of Alsolace]] with a slave ring, centered around [[Livy's Livestock]].
# Mission for [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]:
Dmitri, alongside [[Igor Larionov]], has been tasked with checking upon [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and seeing if the efforts of the massive crustacean have yielded results yet. He is currently in [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. The mission of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is detailed in [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. 

He will not reveal information, even under pain of death, citing that "he will embrace the ever-sea with gratitude."
