# Description:
Igor is a squat, short halfling with one eye and a body that is covered in tattoos symbolizing his allegiance to [[Fedorov's Legion]]. He has gold teeth smattering in his smile. 
# Location:
[[Igor Larionov]] is on a mission that will take him to [[The Sunken Caverns]], a deep sea cave in [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. He is travelling across the island with [[Dmitri Mironov]]. 

**Slave Trader:**
He is also helping [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]] with a slave ring, centered around [[Livy's Livestock]].
# Mission for [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]:
Igor, along with [[Dmitri Mironov]], has been tasked with checking upon [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and seeing if the efforts of the massive crustacean have yielded results yet. He is currently in [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. The mission of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is detailed in [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. 

Igor will reveal information, only if the party guarantees that they can hide him from [[Fedorov's Legion]], since they will surely kill him for betraying them and giving up information. The party doesn't have to uphold this, it is their choice. He is desperate.
