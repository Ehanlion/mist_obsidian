A massive, tall goliath, with white furs draped over his body. He stands nearly 8 feet tall with a massive build.

First encountered in [[Smears-burrow]] on a trade/luxuries-buying expedition, [[His Majesty]] hails from [[Gandoras City]]. He lives in the upper districts of the city and works for [[The Blackwood Ring]]. 
# Relationships:
Works for [[The Blackwood Ring]] in [[Gandoras City]] as a searcher for magical items. He is known as a bit of a brute but is an excellent contact. He has many goliath henchmen who follow his orders and help him.

He has a very vocal distaste for The Trade Guild at [[Gandoras City]]. He has been wronged and cheated by many of the higher ups in the guild on too many of an occasion.
