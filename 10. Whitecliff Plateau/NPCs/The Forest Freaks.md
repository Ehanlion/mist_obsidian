Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: Lives in [[The High Forests]], steals from supply caravans between [[Trawlrock]] and [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and then [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and [[Gullhook]]. 
# Description:
A group of young rascals that raid the supply caravans and other supply trade between the north most cities across [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. They don't often kill, only knock unconscious and steal from the KO'd people. In reports guards make, the group wears large, oversized masks, attack using blowpipes and darts laced with sleeping agents. They jump from trees and bushes out of no where and leave as quickly as they arrived, usually with all of the valuables from the traders. 
# Location:
They have a hide out, hidden deep within [[The High Forests]], specifically the untamed verdant section. Its actually located within another compound, secretly from [[The Many]] (not that they know this). Unlike the one used by [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], this compound's entrances were open when they found it. The vaulted doors, blown to smithereens. It requires no passkey like other compound because it was forced open.

**A secret none can know:**
The compound was actually the site of a battle of [[The Many]] on [[The Final Day of The Many]]. The doors were blasted off by members of [[The Scintillating Order]]. This is a rarity amidst the compounds found on the island. The insides are scarred and damaged from an intense battle. Magical checks such as arcana, at a high DC, reveal the nature of powerful, world altering spells that were used to destroy parts of the compound. 
# Secret and another secret:
**The First Secret:**
*All of the freaks are actually runaway children*. There are people anywhere from their mid 20s down to single digit age ranges. That's why they choose to stun and sleep enemies before taking their stuff - in general, they are relatively *good aligned.* The children came to the forest from all over: [[Gullhook]], [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]], [[Trawlrock]]. Some ran away, some were recruited while playing outside the towns, others were saved from slavers, which brings us to our next secret.

**The Second secret:**
*The freak's leader's parent is actually Livy of Livy's Slaves.* The leading child, who was mistreated and forced into hard, slave labor by her own mother, is actually the eldest daughter of Livy of [[Livy's Livestock]].
