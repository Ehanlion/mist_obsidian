Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: Religious center of [[Gullhook]]
# Description
> [!NOTE] Description of Temple Glade
> Temple Glade lies in stark contrast to the bustling village of Gullhook, separated by rugged, rocky terrain that creates a natural barrier between the sacred site and the rest of the world. This serene sanctuary is located at the heart of a vast, mirror-like lake, its waters calm and reflective, yet teeming with hidden dangers. Beneath the placid surface, crocodiles and other ancient, lurking creatures patrol the depths, serving as both guardians and reminders of the untamed power that surrounds the glade.
>
The glade itself is dominated by a single island at the center of the lake, where the majestic Temple of Alsolace stands. This radiant structure, with its white marble walls and golden accents, gleams brightly under the sun, a beacon of divine light in an otherwise remote and secluded landscape. The temple is accessible only by three ancient rope bridges, each stretching across the water from different points along the rocky shore. These bridges, swaying gently with each step, serve as the sole connection between the glade and the outside world, making every visit a deliberate and introspective journey.
>
Encircling the temple on the island’s edge are numerous shrines dedicated to both the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods. Each shrine is a reflection of the deity it honors—some are imposing and shadowed, draped in dark cloth and lit by flickering candles, while others are bright and welcoming, adorned with vibrant flowers and offerings left by the faithful. Banners bearing the sunburst symbol of Alsolace, the Golden God, flutter in the breeze, their golden threads catching the light and casting shimmering patterns on the lake’s surface.
>
The temple keepers, cloaked in pristine white hooded robes, move silently about their duties, maintaining the sanctity of the temple and the shrines with a quiet, reverent efficiency. Their faces remain hidden within the deep folds of their hoods, adding to the aura of mystery and sacredness that pervades the glade. These keepers are a constant presence, their calm and measured actions underscoring the peaceful yet powerful atmosphere of the glade.
>
Temple Glade is a place of profound reflection and worship, where the devout come to seek guidance and offer prayers in the presence of the gods. The journey across the rope bridges, over the predator-filled waters, serves as a symbolic passage from the mundane world into the divine, marking this as a place where the sacred and the natural world intersect in a delicate balance.
>
The entire area is surrounded by water, kind of like a ring that you cross via a bridge. There are decadent trees lazily gracing the waters and guards and holy members standing on each of the bridges. There are three bridges, North, East, and West, and no South bridge because it is said that to go South is to go backwards in your life.

## Sensory Notes
[[Temple Glade]] should highlight aromatics of a traditional, Buddhist monastery of sorts, but overcome with the overly-bright banners and golden insignia of [[Alsolace]]. 

- Talk about the aromatics of spice and incense in the temples
- Talk about the cool breeze and the briny smell of the sea
- Near the lake, talk about the lapping of small waves and the pungent aroma of wildfowl and crocodiles

The island is covered with rocks, ancient stone paths, and large trees. The paths are covered in moss and lichen. The paths are winding and crooked, the stones uneven and worn from ages of use. 
# Old Religious Shrines
[[Temple Glade]] used to be under stewardship of a benevolent and loving order of monks who tended to all of both [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]]. Their dedication resulted in shrines to each of these gods surrounding the temple. These have since fallen into disrepair and ruin after [[The Following of Alsolace]] supplanted the once-kind monks for their more aggressive campaign for [[Alsolace]]. Nevertheless the statutes remain.

# The Temple Residence
The old monks, and now [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Following of Alsolace]], live in the alcove  that make up the middle part of the island. There are healing domes, rooms, and prayer chambers. There are also preaching rooms for sermons.

Rooms to highlight:
- [[Tennyson Heralds]]'s rooms
- An old prayer chamber now is office for [[Dmitri Mironov]] and liaisons of [[Fedorov's Legion]]. 
- Bathing pools and bath house are living spaces for Sahuaguin. 
- Healing Domes are captive chambers for children and abductees. 
# Special Temple Areas
## Sunken Sanctuary 

> [!NOTE] Description
> The Sanctuary is broken into two main areas: the ruins of the above ground Sanctuary entrance, and the below ground entrance, accessible only via the lake waters. Visually, the above group entrance is a simple, large, circular temple with no roof and four standing pillars. The center is a large broken mosaic of the Prime Deities, covered with insignia of Alsolace. This area is close to the lake's edge.

> [!NOTE] Description of underground area
> The underground area is a vast hall of worship. It holds ancient mosaics of the early days of Mist. These are being covered up. There is also a large altar to the Dawnfather that is being covered with emblems of Alsolace. The surface is inscribed with runes of power. The space glows faintly from the walls. 

The above ground entrance is flooded and caved in. To get to the lower sanctuary requires swimming down in the lake of crocodiles to a hidden entrance dug from stone. It is rough and quickly made and a golden key opens a golden lock on the door. 
### The Sun Altar
The Altar is attributed to [[The Dawnfather]]. It has ancient runes on it that can be invoked to empower a creature. The statues also allows glimpses into the past, before [[Tennyson Heralds]] took over [[Temple Glade]]. 

If cleansed of the tainting of [[Alsolace]] it can bestow a latent gift to a creature. 
### Mosaics 
These mosaics show the following:
- A city being founded - [[Gandoras City]]'s founding
- A king being crowned - The first King, [[Faustus]] of the Many, being crowned to [[The Seat of Stone]]. 
- A pass being carved through mountains - [[Dum Kazad Khalad Throngul]]. 
- A great dark dragon in front of a dying forest - [[Agnedelo the Plague-Bringer]] in [[The Umbrawood]] before it was created.
## Pools of Reflections
## Shrine to Lost Light
## The Celestial Observatory 
# Secret Exit
The Temple has a secret exit that is hidden deep within the **Sunken Sanctuary.** To access it, you must swim down in the lake of crocodiles to the stone gate, now locked by a golden lock, unlocked with a golden key. 

The exit links directly to [[Livy's Livestock]] on the edge of [[The Untamed Verdant]]. [[Livy's Livestock]] exports the abducted children and gold to [[Fedorov's Legion]] via [[The Bloodstone Pass]]. This exit is an old passage, far before [[Tennyson Heralds]]. There are newer minecart tracks laid down in it.
