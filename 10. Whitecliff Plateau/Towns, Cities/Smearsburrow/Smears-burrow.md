Regional location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] 
Subsection: None
# At First Glance:
>Smears-Burrow is a bustling little town. Its people rush around a town square moving fish from the seas into ice-rock cellars for safe keeping. The buildings are made of a dark coral-looking stone and an abundance of strangely coloured plants grows from the stones. The town feels low, not a lot of high buildings cross your view. Many of the buildings are nestled into the sides of small knolls in the landscape, with lazy paths drifting between them.  
# Notable NPCs:
1. [[Reggie Brown]] is a well liked fishermen who went missing some days before a raid happened on the town.
2. **The Grung**: since Smears-burrow relies on dive-fishing, they have a large amount of Grung living in the town. They are perfectly civil of course, but it is still an oddity.
3. **Buster Croaks**, elder of the Grung. Green grung with various tattoos of the great fish he has caught.
4. **Simon Karbala**, elder of the rest. Old gentlemen of the village. Is a aging human with thick grey hair. Still enjoys fishing of course, but is getting on in his years.
5. **Freya Depths-Chaser**, revered of the rest. Young female Tiefling fisher-women. She once held onto a great fish and was dragged to the depths but caught the fish. Earned her the title 'Depths-Chaser.'

# The Center of the Town:
The town is centered on the library with the ancient and massive birch tree being the center piece of the town. Lines with lanterns hanging from them are hung from the long-since petrified branches of the old tree and at night they light up the town center.

The center of the town is a large open, circular clearing with an elevated stone platform in the center. Meetings get held here and people gather in the open green space to hear town elders speak. 

The tavern, both stores, the library, and the market stalls are all concentrated here, ringing around the center green area described above.

> As you gaze upon the center of town, you feel warmth and a sense of hominess. A large central stone platform raises out from a circular green space set in the middle of the town. Around this green are you see a strange path way made from seemingly green stones that protrude from flowing water beneath. It looks like a floating path way on top of a flowing stream that encircles the town center. Set off of this and around the town center are small cottages as well as two stores, a tavern, and a tall, ancient, petrified birch tree with ropes streaming off its upper branches and over the town center. There are glowing lanterns hung from these ropes that cast a warm light on the center. People of all races bustle in the towns center, but notably there seems to be a sense of apprehension in the air. 
# Parts of the Town:
## The Library: "The Old Birch Library"
This library is built into the massive, old husk of a ancient birch tree. It is quite expansive vertically. It is a central building in the town. The old birch tree stand at the main square of the town. 

Inside there are three level of books, built into natural book shelves carved from inside the old trunk of the birch tree. There is a small adjoining building built into the exposed roots that serves as the librarians house. 

To cast light on the town center, ropes with dangling lanterns are hung from the tree's upper branches. 

1. Librarian is named Mary-Anne Birch. She is an Elf. 
## The Tavern: "The Laughing Elk"
This tavern is a large multi-storied building, one of the few multistory structures in Smears-burrow. The bottom floor is crafted from the same sea stone that most other buildings are made from while the top floor rests above it, made from a light wood. The roof, like many other buildings, is a sea slate. The kitchen is set into the hill the tavern is built into and small chimneys rise from this hill, wafting tantalizing smoke into the air. 

Since Smears-burrow is large, this tavern is often rowdy. It is also the only place of food in the town, making it a popular destination for every meal of the day. Inside the bottom floor is a warm eating hall with long tables and the upstairs has a bar for drinking as well as smaller tables for games. Outside the bar are more tables, warm lanterns sitting atop old barrels and a lot of outdoor seating, sprawling towards the Grung's path and the green town center. 

The tavern has many cooks since it has a very high demand and multiple bartenders that all work together.
1. Bartender: Helga (wood elf)
2. Bartender: Belga (wood elf)
3. Cook: Bjorn (Leonine)
4. Cook: Storga (Satyr)
5. Cook: Lyra (Human)
#### Mini-Mission: Not all is as it seems:
In the tavern, there was a poisoning. [[His Majesty]] was accused by [[Deion Deus]] of poisoning [[Jordan Leabrook]]. The idea arose since [[His Majesty]] passed [[Jordan Leabrook]] a glass of liquor that 'was darker than others' and [[Jordan Leabrook]] because horribly poisoned. [[His Majesty]] did not poison the glass and thought someone else did.

The glass was poisoned by a shape-changer. There are two at the bar posing as Helga and Belga. Both are normally reclusive, silent, and awkward around guests but the shape-changers are boisterous, confident, and have a desire to get information. They poisoned a glass with red grung poison to frame the grung. 
## The Mission Board:
The town's request board is located on the side of the tavern, directly to the right of the entrance way. People from the town post about jobs they need, requests, or notices. 
#### Current Offerings:
- [x] A man offering coin for labor hauling fish to market. The man has a bad back and has a hard time lifting his catch up to the town. 
- [ ] A man asking about his friend, [[Reggie Brown]].
- [x] A grung asking someone to dive off the coat for her lost ring. The notices mentions that 'divorce is imminent' should the ring not be found. 
- [x] Two man who want some diving partners to hunt a particularly large red fish that has been eating fish near the docks. The fish is a monstrosity.
- [ ] A women who wants help cleaning off some of the buildings in the center of town. There are odd growths of coral on it.
- [ ] 3 Grung who are daring people to try sliding down 'The Algae Tunnel.' (this is the name of the chute channeling the Grung's Path water down the cliff towards the sea.) The reward is 'water,' which is actually a potion of water breathing (the grung breath water so to them it is just 'water').
- [x] A grung asking for help researching, classifying, and documenting 'The Magic Grung Rock.' A historian and someone who is good at books is requested. 
## The Store: "The Dull Store"
This is the general store in Smears-burrow. Like other towns along the coast, they are supplied by a trade caravan every other week or so. This store is a simply barn-like structure with an attached stone building. It acts like a warehouse, storing necessary goods. 

1. Run by a man named Zurbag. He is a beefy orc. 
## The Rarities Store: "The Shiny Store"
Unlike other towns, Smears-burrow sees a trove of oddities pulled up from the bottom of the sea. They get highly unique fishes as well as gems from their fisheries and their mines. It is possible to buy the following here:
1. unique gems of every color
2. decorative clusters of rare coral
3. Grung poison (donated by Grung to Snaglak to sell to locals since it helps to kill fish quicker.)
4. Cheaper armors and weapons. 
5. 'Descending rocks' (normal rocks that are smooth and nice)
6. Descending belts (to hold the descending rocks of course...)
7. A trident of returning (+1)
8. A manual trident of returning (just a trident with a very thin rope attached to it.)

In general, there is a good chance anything that isn't a fish and is remotely colorful is sold here. If it doesn't get sold, Snaglak will bundle it up and eventually make a trip to [[Gandoras City]] to sell it there for a higher price. 

1. Run by a man named Snaglak. He is a Grung. 
## The Grung Ponds:
The people of Smears-burrow love the Grung that live there. Not only are they civil, but they are wonderful fishers. The grung make most of their homes nearby to the large portion of cottages where the rest of the village lives. 
#### The Grung Path
Leading off from the town center is another pathway which leads to the Grung Ponds. It is unique and made from darker green stones unlike the white flagstones comprising the other paths. The pathway is also recessing into the ground and water flows between the stones that make up the path. The green color comes from the algae that has grown into the stones. The reason for this is simple: a natural spring feeds the Grung Ponds with fresh water. In return, this overflows the ponds and flows down the pathway. 

Since the pathway leads to the town center, it flows water towards the town center. The path way encircles the green area that is the town's center and the flows off in a channel that has been built towards the cliff face. It flows down a tall, dangerous, circular tunnel only 5 feet in diameter that leads directly down to sea level to drain the water off. 
#### The Grung's Spring
The Grung ponds are very close to the town and are located near what the locals call "The Stone Teeth." The Stone Teeth are three massive stone pyramid rocks that are set at vertices of an equilateral triangle shape. They surround a spring that spills its water down a hill into the Grung Ponds. 
#### The Grung Ponds
The pools are a peaceful and tranquil place to live. Water from the Stone Teeth spills down the hill that they rest on, cascading over rocks, into the low grounds of The Grung Ponds. Lilypad's, floating flowers, plant growths, and stones dot the surface of the Grung Ponds. The center is clear since this is the deepest part by a long shot.

The ponds are very deep and cavernous as you swim down. Grungs make their homes in pockets on the walls of the ponds as you swim down. At the deepest part of the cave is the great chamber of the grung, where the grung have their most sacred artifact as well as their throne for their leader. 
#### The Magic Grung Rock
The Grung (unbeknownst to them) covet one of the [[Shard]] above all else. They just revere it as a powerful thing that was resting in the pools when they first found it. This one of the [[Shard]] sits above the grung throne. This specific one of the [[Shard]] is Key 3, a large conch shell with glittering green accents and marking. It makes the water unnaturally clear, crisp, and clean. It also gives the ponds healing powers, allowing anyone who lives in them to have unnaturally good health.

When the Grung found it, it was resting with a body of one of [[The Many]]. The Grung, not knowing what the body was nor its importance, discarded it and grabbed the [[Shard]] that it held and coveted it as their most prized possession. If asked about it, they do not know what [[The Many]] nor what the [[Shard]] are, but they do know that the body looked human like.  
#### The Grung-mocracy 
A leader of the Grung is chosen by who catches the greatest fish the year before. As expected, this position changes a lot and is a fierce competition amongst the Grung. They have a massive chamber where they track Grung fisher's scores. They are such great fishers because of how competitive they are. 
#### Types of Grung:
There are three types of Grung: green grung, blue grung, and red grung. There is a fabled black grung but one has not been born for generations. The poisons of the grung increase in potency from green to blue and to red. Green causes mild nauseous and disorientation (+1d6 poison damage), blue causes vivid hallucinations and intense pain (+3d6 poison damage), and red causes organ melting and death (+9d6 poison damage). Concentrated dosages reflect the damage numbers listed. In grung society, green grung are usually home tenders and simple folk, blue grung are fishers and gatherers, and red grung are warriors. 

1. Their current leader is named Buster Croaks. He is an elder, Blue, Grung. 
## The White Cliff Mines:
The cliffs nears Smears-burrow are rich with crystals alongside deposits of [[Ice-Rocks]]. Permanent scaffoldings have been built along the cliff face to allow miners to trek down to the mines. 

**Getting to the mines:**
People can either walk East-ways (right when walking towards the cliff) which will take them down the pathway to the fishing jetties. People can also walk West-ways (left when walking towards the cliff) which will take them into the scaffolding for the white cliff mines.

**Caves and resources:**
The scaffolding is built to connect the entrances to the various caves that exist along the cliff's face. There are a number of caves and they are each rich with ores, gems, sea-crystals, and [[Ice-Rocks]]. The further down the cliff face, towards the water's edge, you go to enter a cave, the more dangerous that cave is said to be.

**The dangers that exist:**
Some caves exist right at the water's edge making it deadly and difficult to mine from them. It is rumored that fearsome dark-dwelling sea creatures like the 'invisible night eel' or the 'hook fish' will attack if you mine in these caves. 

**Extracting the resources:**
To get resources up to the cliff's top, multiple cranes have been built at the top of the cliffs. They can be cranked from the top of the cliff. They have large buckets or straps attached to the end allowing them to haul up heavy and precious loads. They also are able to pivot on a rotating platform. 
## The Quarry Stores:
Near the mines are large, long buildings that serve as warehouses to store cut stones from the mines. The mines have [[Ice-Rocks]], a valuable commodity as well as numerous varieties of gem stones. The [[Ice-Rocks]] are the mains things stored here, but they also store cut stones for building new houses and stuff like that.
# How They Fish:
> As you look towards the cliffs, you can see a walkway of slatted planks leading to the cliff face. There are piles of rope and what appear to be some large buckets of large metal clips nearby. Some men appear from below, lugging massive crates full of lobsters.

**Not using boats:**
Smears-burrow fishes without the use of boats. There is a visitors jetty where visiting boats can dock, but the townspeople don't fish from boats. Instead, at the base of the cliffs, they have built long floating jetties out about a hundred feet into the ocean. The waters directly off the cliff from Smears-burrow are an excellent place to farm shellfish like lobsters and crabs, as well as smaller fish. There is also a visitors wharf built a ways off from the main jetties for visiting ships. 

**Fishing:**
Most 'fishermen' here are instead divers. They set out cages and traps for shellfish and then dive down beneath the jetties with breath-holds to go spear-fishing. It is far more productive. Fish are caught with rod or pole or with a fishing spear underwater. Scuttle fish, e.g. anything fishy with legs are caught in traps or hunter with nets. In general, the fish brought up at [[Smears-burrow]] are larger and more succulent than other villages but less is also brought up. Quality over quantity.  

**Getting down:**
Much like getting down to the mines, fishers and diver take precarious scaffolding pathways down to the jetties below. Some experience fishermen will actually dive off the cliffs, but this is few and far between. Most just walk down. To get to the fishing jetties one would walk East-ways (right when walking towards the cliff) to get down to the fishing jetties. 

**Ships docking:**
The town does NOT have any ships. Visiting ships are always forced to dock on the visitors wharfs, a ways away from the fishing jetties that dominate the sea nearest to the cliffs. 

Any ship, scuff mark, or oddity a ship could make against any one of the main fishing jetties should stand out as odd or weird. 

**Punishment for Poaching:**
If a fisherman is caught poaching off of another fisherman's fishing spot or crates the punishment is severe. A guilty fisherman is sentenced to death, an overwhelmingly severe punishment for the small town but a necessary one. They are built on community so poaching directly harms the whole community. The death is executed in the kelp chute, the tunnel draining the grung path to the sea beneath. It is rocky and jagged, shredding the body into fish food. 
# Events:
1. **Monthly Fish Off:** Teams of 4 accepted. Judging done by the towns elders, one from the Grung and two from the rest of the town (since that is how the percentage population divides, 33% Grung, 66% other). Categories for: largest catch, most dangerous catch, most odd catch, and prettiest fish. Gold prizes to the winners. Many come from [[Saddle-Port]], [[Herringshold]], and [[Gullhook]] to join in. 
2. **The Great Other-Grung Capture the Flag Game:** Every year, around when the season begin to change back from cold and frosty to warm and spring-y, a game of capture the flag is held. No maiming, but blunt trauma and knocking people out is allowed. It is just for fun. Winning team gets a trophy. The Grung have lost this for 8 years in a row now and would love some help to win. 
3. **The Weekly Ball:** Every week a dance with music is hosted in the center of the town. Bands can volunteer to play at the dance. People dance under the light of the stars, many candles, and lanterns that hand overhead. 
4. **The Weekly Cliff Dive:** Every week on 5th's day, a cliff diving event is held, judged by crowd decision. It occurs at midday. Members compete to dive of the cliffs. Tricks midair are just as important as diving into a smaller target. Floating rings are set on the water below and divers try to dive into the smallest one they can. Medics on standby. 
# Vanishings:
Smears-burrow has lost 3 individuals:
1. Mary-Anne Birch (elf), the librarian for the Old Birch Library. 
2. Fogram Heavygaze (goliath), a prolific miner 
3. Gurdath Fallonswallow (firbolg), a well liked and boisterous miner
4. [[Reggie Brown]] (human), a fisherman who, while missing, is not exactly a vanishing.
