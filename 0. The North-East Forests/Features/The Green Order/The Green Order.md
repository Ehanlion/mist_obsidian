Regional Location: [[The North-East Forests]]
Subsection: Within [[The Twilight Woods]]
# At First Glance:
*As you continue through the dense forests, forging small creeks and clambering over knotted roots of ancients trees, the air seems to clear. The forest seems calmer and more misty. The sounds of the birds chirping, and wolves baying in the distance seem to mellow as you stand amidst the swaying branches, golden light filtering down onto you. You notices a message written in Elvish is inscribed on a large tree, a translation in common lies beneath it in smaller font.

If approached, read the message on the tree: 
*Here starts the domain of the Green Order. If you are not one of us and one with the forest turn back or face dire consequences.*

GM Note: Describe this tree and other, oddly larger ones that seem to make up what appears to be a crude barrier, stretching off into the forest. The space between these trees has small dancing, constellations of light, almost like miniature star clusters. If the party has not completed [[Mission, Entering the Green Order]], they will face the 'dire consequences' alluded to by the message (which means combat).
- Note that, while combat is inevitable, the Green Order are not murders and are always looking for more members or friendlies. If the party surrenders or stands down allow the combat to turn into a pitch to start the [[Mission, Entering the Green Order]].
# Notable NPCs (if any):
The Green order is mainly elves, but the real requirement is some proficiency with the forest (which means Druidic proficiencies). The following are major NPCs that are apart of the Green Order:
- [[Elder Thistleton]]: Elder of the Green Order.
- [[Sylvia Starlight]]: The first of the Green Order, all power of the Order derives from her sacrifice. She is said to be of divine inheritance. 

# Related Locations:
The Green Order is located just to the East of [[The North-West Highlands]], in regions of the [[The Twilight Woods]], East into the forest from [[King Gillian's Channel]]. It is apart of the larger region of [[The North-West Highlands]].

# Related Missions:
- [[Mission, Entering the Green Order]]: Needed to complete in order to be allowed deeper into the Green Order's territory. If not completed, maybe not the first combat, but a later encounter will seal the fate of the party if they are found trespassing. 
- [[Mission, Potions for the Green Order]]: Only completable after Entering the Green Order. Players go on deep expeditions into the [[The Twilight Woods]] and beyond in order to search for rare ingredients and harvestable things in order to create exotic potions for the Green Order. For which they will pay a pretty penny. Assigned by [[Pombo Wrinkle, the Short One]] if the players are accepted into the Green Order and express interest in potions. 

# Deeper Dive:
This section needs to cover the types of people that populate the area, events (if any) that occur in this location, buildings or structures etc. that make up this location, and anything else. Basically, if a player asks about something, you should aim to have an answer here.
