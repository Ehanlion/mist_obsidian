Regional Location: [[The North-East Forests]]
Subsection: Within [[The Deep Woods]]

These are the silvery, magical woods of [[The North-East Forests]]. They have normal trees, yes, but they are teeming with silvery willows and birch trees. The flora and fauna seem to be touched with moonlights. The branches cast shadows akin to dancing lights and on top of all that, the forests are the proud dominion of [[The Green Order]].

# Feelers:
	The trees here whisper and sing as the breeze blows through them. They are the closest to the mist cliffs so mist rolls in gently through the quiet forest, settling to create a cooling blanket over the forest. Light shimmers and glitters through the glassy, translucent branches of odd trees, known only to live in the Twilight Wood. There is the faint crackling and babbling of nearby brooks and streams and for some reason, the unshakable feeling as if someone, or something, is watching you.

What the woods **smell** like:
1. A faint scent of vanilla and ozone. It's sweet. No sign of decay or rot. Even the earthen smells seem faint and far.
2. The intoxicating aroma of mystical herbs and flowers, each breath filled with scents that seem to elevate the spirit and calm the mind.
3. The fresh, invigorating scent of the twilight air, tinged with a faint, sweet fragrance that is both soothing and enigmatic.
4. The earthy, grounding smell of the forest floor, mixed with a hint of something ethereal, as if the very soil is infused with magic.
5. Occasional wafts of aromatic incense, as if the forest itself is performing a sacred ritual, filling the air with a scent that is both ancient and otherworldly.
6. The delicate, almost imperceptible scent of stardust, a reminder of the cosmic connection of this mystical forest, where the earthly and the celestial intertwine.

What the woods **sound** like:
1. The baying of wolves in the background. Ever preset in the nights.
2. The hooting of owls, always active in the twilight of these woods.
3. The delicate tinkling of ethereal chimes, carried on a gentle breeze, weaving a spell of tranquility throughout the forest.
4. The soft, melodious songs of mystical birds, hidden within the silver foliage, their tunes imbued with an enchanting quality that seems to speak directly to the soul.
5. The whispering of the trees, each rustle of their luminous leaves telling ancient, magical tales that float through the air like a delicate spell.
6. The faint, harmonic resonance of crystals hidden beneath the forest floor, creating a symphony of soothing, mystical sounds that resonate with the twilight.
7. The subtle, rhythmic pulsing of the forest itself, as if the land breathes with a life of its own, a quiet heartbeat of magic and mystery.

What the woods **look** like:
1. Shimmering, glistening leaves.
2. Even in daylight, the grounds are awash with a pale, moon-like light.
3. It is soft and fuzzy, the mist wrapping trees in its embrace, you vision gives out after a hundred feet or so, fading into just mist.
4. Trees with bark that glistens like polished silver, their trunks and branches twisting into elegant, otherworldly shapes that capture the ethereal twilight.
5. Glowing flowers and fungi, dotting the forest floor and tree trunks, their bioluminescent light creating a dance of colors in the dim light.
6. Shimmering, translucent creatures, reminiscent of sprites or faeries, flitting playfully among the trees, leaving trails of sparkling light in their wake.
7. Pools of liquid silver, scattered throughout the forest, reflecting the twilight sky and adding to the surreal, dreamlike beauty of the landscape.
8. Enigmatic, glowing symbols and patterns, appearing on tree trunks and stones, pulsing gently with an ancient, magical energy.
