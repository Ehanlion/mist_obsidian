These stands of massive, thick trees stand tall amidst the sea of tree-tops in [[The Deep Woods]]. These massive iron-pines are so large, great creatures make their homes amidst the dense, sprawling branches. Some of these pines can stand over 500 feet tall, towering over the other trees in the forests.
