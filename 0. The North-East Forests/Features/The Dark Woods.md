These are the darkest, most foreboding, and most evil of all the woods within [[The North-East Forests]]. They are known specifically for the great evil creatures they hide and sequester away in their darkness. It is said that no monster hunter can call themselves a fearless hunter until the day they return with the head of a great monstrosity from the Dark Woods.

	It is silent, oddly silent. The faint cawings of birds, the growling of distant bears, and the cacophany of wild noises die down as you step further into these woods. Silence. You get the faint idea that something is watching you, and that 'something' is very hungry indeed. 

What the woods **smell** like:
1. The heavy, musty scent of damp and decay, a reminder of the unrelenting cycle of life and death in the forest.
2. The sharp, tangy odor of rotting wood, permeating the air and intensifying the sense of desolation.
3. The faint, earthy smell of fungus and mold thriving on the forest floor and the sides of decaying trees.
4. The occasional whiff of something unidentifiable and unsettling, a scent that speaks of age and forgotten histories.
5. The clean, mineral smell of stone and soil, a stark contrast to the organic decay, hinting at the underlying resilience of nature.

What the woods **sound** like:
1. The creaking and groaning of ancient, rotting trees swaying precariously, their sounds echoing through the still air.
2. The occasional crack of a branch breaking under its own decay, the sound sharp and startling in the quiet of the forest.
3. The distant, hollow howl of wind as it weaves through the gnarled branches, carrying with it a sense of desolation.
4. The soft, unsettling rustle of withered leaves and dried twigs underfoot, breaking the silence with each step.
5. The eerie whispers that seem to emanate from the shadows, as if the forest itself is murmuring dark secrets.

What the woods **look** like:
1. The oppressive canopy of dark, withered leaves, so thick that it swallows all but the faintest glimmers of light.
2. The twisted forms of the trees, their bark blackened and peeling, standing like silent sentinels of the decay.
3. The remnants of what might have been a vibrant forest, now reduced to a landscape of greys and browns, a testament to the ravages of time.
4. Occasional glimpses of faded beauty – a corpse of a massive colorful animal, now covered with moss and fungi consuming its form. 
5. The fog that clings low to the ground, adding a ghostly, ethereal quality to the forest, as if it's a bridge to another, more sinister world.
