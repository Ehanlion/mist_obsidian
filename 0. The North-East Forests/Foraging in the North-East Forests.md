*I hope you have been trained to use that plant. One would not wish for you to, erm, poison yourself...again...*
# A note on foraging:
Players should be incentivized to search for unique and rare plants in the North-East forests. Different regions of the forest will have different ranges of plants to forage. Some missions will give the ability to use these foraged supplies for potion brewing. 

**Missions that relate:**:
- [[Mission, Entering the Green Order]]: Nature and plant challenge will give limited crafting proficiency with North-Eastern Forest plant specimens.
