# Feelers Section
This section should contain feelers for each sub-category of the region. Ideally, these should be memorized and learned so that you can recite them from heart. 

These are smells, visuals, and sounds that players hear for a given place. I think these should be generalized so that ANY town or ANY place could have these descriptions applied. 



# Regional Breakdown
This section should break down and link to all the subcategories of the region. All the major cities, all the major areas, and anything that can be walked to should be listed here.

# Secrets of the Region
This section should breakdown any major secret locations that are NOT readily apparent to the players.
