# Character Description:
Elder Thistleton (also called Grumpy Thorns by the children of the forest) is a prideful, respected elder amidst the [[The Green Order]]. He is tall and noble; his shining hair cropped close, an oddity for normal elves, and wears a wreath of thorns circling his temple. A mottled green hooded cloak with a golden insignia of a willow tree over his heart drapes over his simple brown clothes. He has dark brown eyes, tight facial features, but a warm smile (not that it seems the children of the village notice that last remark).

**Deeper Description:**
-  Close cropped brown hair. Dark brown eyes. A circlet of thorns wrapping around his temple. 
-  Tall, above 6 foot easily. Slender built.
-  Massive bow hewn from a reddish, thorny wood.
-  Mottled green and brown, hooded cloak. Underneath are simple brown, soft clothes. 
# Character Relationships:
It is said that Thistleton is an ancient relative of [[Sylvia Starlight]], and he is the heir to [[Sylvia's Starlight Grove]]. (This of course, is true, but Thistleton does not believe it. However, finding a text amidst the [[Library of the Birch Collective]] that can concretely prove Thistleton's lineage would case SOMETHING COOL TO HAPPEN NOT SURE YET THO HAHAH)

# Character Locations:
- Since [[The Green Order]] is located in the North-East forests,    specifically [[The Twilight Woods]], this is where Thistleton spends most of his time. 
-  He is a tentative librarian at the [[Library of the Birch Collective]] and as such spends his time there. If asked, he searches for ways to heal [[Sylvia's Starlight Grove]] since it is losing its power. (Refer to [[Mission, Save Sylvia's Starlight Grove]])
