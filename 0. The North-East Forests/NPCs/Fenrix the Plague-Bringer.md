Fenrix is an Ancient Black Dragon, and according to [[Book - The Greatest of the Great]], [[Ignel Valis]] slayed this dragon and went down in the fight.

This is, of course, false. Ignel did defeat Fenrix, but he bound his soul to someone that he was working with: a great warlord, now the leader of [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] who's named [[Garrick Blackthorn]]. Garrick now has the power of the ancient soul of the dragon, allowing him to perform ungodly feats that no normal black dragonborn could manage. 

Ignel was working with Garrick in an effort to restore balance to this island. However, after the Dragon was defeated and Fenrix's soul melded with Garrick's, their alliance dissolved as Garrick left to rule [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] and bring them to glory. 

### Restoring Fenrix:
If [[Garrick Blackthorn]] is defeated, he who defeats him will get to interact with the bound soul of [[Fenrix the Plague-Bringer]]. The soul will play like the victim and that they are innocent and that Garrick has been using them. They will beg to be released.

The Player can choose to destroy or release the spirt. Destroying is will rend the soul, finally cause this body of Fenrix to die. However, if the player releases the spirt, Fenrix will rise again in all of his terrible glory.
