*Not much is know about Sylvia, at least from a first hand account. Generational tales passed down between elves and kin in the [[The Green Order]] mark Sylvia as the founder of a sacred grove, now called [[Sylvia's Starlight Grove]]. The power of nature that it gives to the [[The Green Order]] is said to have been given to the grove by Sylvia as she faded into twilight, never to be seen again.*

Sylvia is alive -- unbeknownst to [[The Green Order]].
