*The trees here whisper and sing as the breeze blows through them. They are the closest to the mist cliffs so mist rolls in gently through the quiet forest, settling to create a cooling blanket over the forest. Light shimmers and glitters through the glassy, translucent branches of odd trees, known only to live in the Twilight Wood. There is the faint crackling and babbling of nearby brooks and streams and for some reason, the unshakable feeling as if someone, or something, is watching you.*
