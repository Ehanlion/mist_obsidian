These are the silvery, magical woods of [[The North-East Forests]]. They have normal trees, yes, but they are teeming with silvery willows and birch trees. The flora and fauna seem to be touched with moonlights. The branches cast shadows akin to dancing lights and on top of all that, the forests are the proud dominion of [[The Green Order]]. 

# Feelers:
	The trees here whisper and sing as the breeze blows through them. They are the closest to the mist cliffs so mist rolls in gently through the quiet forest, settling to create a cooling blanket over the forest. Light shimmers and glitters through the glassy, translucent branches of odd trees, known only to live in the Twilight Wood. There is the faint crackling and babbling of nearby brooks and streams and for some reason, the unshakable feeling as if someone, or something, is watching you.

What the woods **smell** like:
1. A faint scent of vanilla and ozone. It's sweet. No sign of decay or rot. Even the earthen smells seem faint and far.

What the woods **taste** like:
1. The gurgling streams are cold and fresh, their waters pure and unmuddied.
2. The air is moist and damp, it leaving a faint sweetness in your mouth as you inhale.
3. Exhaling blows a cloud of warm steam from you lips; it is cold, oddly cold for a forest. 

What the woods **sound** like:
1. The baying of wolves in the background. Ever preset in the nights.
2. The hooting of owls, always active in the twilight of these woods.
