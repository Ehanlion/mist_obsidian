# Welcome to Mist:
>*Those who find Mist are often lost. They sail through storms and great, cold waves, through dense fog and cutting rains to be greeted by the glistening island now clear in their sights. A welcome sight. A comforting sight. You can set your gaze upon the white cliffs and tall mountains of Mist. Off its coast bob colorful ships and trawlers, taming the rough seas to make a days catch. Arcane runes glow and swirls around sea obelisks as you sail past, their magic revered, and unmuddied. If you set your ship to port, the vibrant chimes of the towns ring through your sails and jaunty music from the harbors drift into your ears. And if you leave your ship? The adventures that lay ahead may well just define your life. Why would you ever leave. This island is so, well, perfect. You won't forget your ship who saw you weather those high seas so long ago, but your life is here now. For this is the island of Mist; a sequestered jewel of magic, mystery, adventure, and wildlife; its people unique and mysterious; its ways, a trove of treasure yet to discover. This is an adventure; this is Mist.*

# A Blurb From the Author:
	Mist is Ethan's creation for a dungeons and dragons campaign. It is NOT complete; what project ever is? It should feel magical and compelling. I hope to evoke my player's emotions and senses with every description I give. The cool salty breezes of the cliffsides or the hot winds of the desert, the granules of sand ripping small cuts across your exposed skin. Maybe the cold peaks of the mountains, your numb ears can hear the baying of a winter wolf far in the distance. It needs to feel alive. And it will be vibrant, in every description I narrate. - Ethan
