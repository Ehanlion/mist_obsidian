# Welcome to Mist
> [!NOTE] Ethan's Welcome to Mist
> As you stand atop the towering white cliffs of the northwest headlands, the cool ocean breeze whips through your hair, carrying with it the sharp scent of salt and the distant cry of seabirds. The tall sea grass around you dances in the wind, whispering secrets of the deep, as the vast expanse of the ocean stretches out before you. In the far distance, where the sky meets the sea, you can just make out the massive, shifting cliffs of Mist, their forms elusive and ever-changing under the veil of fog that clings to the horizon.
>
Your mind drifts back to the lands you've traversed, each memory vivid and alive. You recall the rugged beauty of the wind-swept headlands, where the earth drops away to reveal the roaring sea below, and the mystical sea caves where the waves echo like the chants of ancient spirits. You remember the thrill of breaking through the waves as you sailed past the towering obelisks that rise from the ocean like the petrified fingers of giants, their surfaces etched with runes of a forgotten age. There were moments of quiet too, like when you found yourself on the deck of a weathered fishing trawler, the rhythmic rocking of the boat lulling you into a peaceful reverie as the cliffs cast their cool shadow over you.
>
Your journey took you further, across the headlands and into the great channel of King Gillian. Here, mighty merchant ships laden with goods from distant lands glide serenely up the channel, their sails billowing in the wind. Ahead lies the city of Gandoras, a magnificent fortress of stone and steel, its tall white spires crowned with glittering flags that catch the sunlight and send it shimmering across the landscape for miles. The city stands as a beacon of civilization, its walls protecting the bustling life within from the untamed wilds beyond.
>
To the north, the great forests loom, their dark depths a world unto themselves. The trees rise like ancient sentinels, their thick canopies blotting out the sun, casting the forest floor into perpetual twilight. The air here is thick with the scent of pine and earth, and the sounds of unseen creatures echo through the woodsâ€”a bark, a growl, the rustle of leaves as something large moves in the shadows. Venture far enough and you might find the fain, starlit groves of the twilight woods, where the trees seem to glow with a soft, otherworldly light, and the paths are dappled with silver moonlight even at midday. But tread carefully, for beyond the twilight woods lie the dark woods, a twisted realm where the trees grow gnarled and the air is thick with the stench of decay. Here, the abominations of the dark prowl, and only the bravest or most foolhardy dare to enter.
>
To the south, the discordant plains stretch out, a desolate and eerie landscape where the wind carries a constant, unsettling wail. The ancient stone circle at the heart of the plains amplifies this eerie song, and many who venture there speak of hearing strange whispers in the wind, as if the very stones themselves are alive. The plains are a place of madness and mystery, where the line between reality and illusion blurs, and those who walk them must be prepared to face not just physical challenges, but battles of the mind and soul.
>
To the east, the towering spine of Mist rises like a wall against the sky, its peaks shrouded in perpetual fog. The mountains are treacherous, with only three harrowing passes to choose from. Whether you brave the high, icy altitudes, the treacherous mid-range paths, or the dark, eerie tunnels that burrow beneath the mountains, each route demands its toll. Yet, those who survive the crossing find themselves in the pirate jewel of the coast, a lawless city where three factions vie for control in a never-ending turf war. Here, danger lurks around every corner, but so too does opportunity, for those bold enough to seize it.
>
If the mountains are not to your liking, you may instead brave the discordant plains, enduring the mental trials they present, before descending the cliffs of the middle steppe and crossing the deep, shadowed gorge that splits Mist in two. Beyond lies the great arid expanse of the wastes, a barren desert where life is harsh and unforgiving. Only the strongest survive here, and good coin is paid for those willing to escort precious goods across the desert's heart, racing against time and the elements to reach the distant markets before their competitors.
>
At the very southern tip of the island lies Sonderton, a harsh and efficient walled city where order reigns supreme. The rules here are strict, and justice is swift, a stark contrast to the more lenient ways of the north. But for those who can navigate its rigid structure, Sonderton offers a wealth of opportunities, its markets filled with goods from across the known world.
>
But these are the tales of a journey already taken, memories of lands explored and challenges overcome. Now, as you stand once more atop the northwest cliffs, the sea breeze cool against your skin, the taste of salt lingering on your lips, you realize that your story is far from over. The lands of Mist stretch out before you, full of mystery and adventure, waiting for you to leave your mark. Your path is yours to forge, and should you succeed, your deeds will be sung of in the halls of history, immortalized in the pages of legend.
>
This is adventure. This is Mist.
# A Blurb From the Author
Mist is Ethan's creation for a dungeons and dragons campaign. It is NOT complete; what project ever is? It should feel magical and compelling. I hope to evoke my player's emotions and senses with every description I give. The cool salty breezes of the cliffsides or the hot winds of the desert, the granules of sand ripping small cuts across your exposed skin. Maybe the cold peaks of the mountains, your numb ears can hear the baying of a winter wolf far in the distance. It needs to feel alive. And it will be vibrant, in every description I narrate. - Ethan
# Index and Locations
The island is divided, roughly, into 4 quadrants, bisected by the North, East, South, and West meridians. Each harbors it own climate, locations, peoples, and mysteries. Each is headed by its own order, if any at all. Each is beautiful and deadly in their own ways. This is an index of each of them and their attractions:

1. [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]: A placid high steppe bordering the seas, towering over the waters below on tall white cliffs
2. [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]: A deep throng of a forest and jungle, hosting the most diverse and strange wildlife and creatures on the island
3. [[The Discordant Plains]]: A desolate and dangerous region of plains plagued with abnormalities, centered around an ancient and strange stone circle,
4. [[The Meridian Cleave]]: A massive chasm that splits the island along its center, filled with raging and choppy sea water
5. [[The Chromatic Fangs]]: Vast peaks that isolate the south-east, only passable by one of three treacherous crossings, they are tall and deadly 
6. [[The Stormlocked Frontier]]: A chaotic rabblerousing coast filled with once-criminals, pirates, and corsairs, at odds with brutal orders along the coast 
7. [[The Fractured Coast]]: A strong, dictatorship, eastern-ish monocracy that rules the few stone outcroppings outside the wastes 
8. [[The Scorchsand Wastes]]: Brutal deserts rife with the most dangerous monsters in Mist, but necessary to cross to supply the Fracture Coast by brave crossers
