# Welcome to Mist:

> As you stand atop the great white cliffs of the north west headlands, a cool ocean breeze rips through your hair and the sea grass rustles beside you. In the far distances, the vast reaches of the sea are interrupted by massive shifting cliffs of Mist. You think back upon the lands you've travelled. First across the wind-swept headlands of the north west, diving in the mystical sea caves, breaking waves on the seas as you traverse the obelisk fields, or just simply relaxing on the back deck of a fishing trawler as the waves rock the boat up or down with the white cliffs casting a cooling shadow upon you. From the headlands, to the great channel of King Gillian, where merchant ships laden with great stock glide up the channel towards the massive, walled city of Gandoras. The tall white spires with glittering flags dominate the landscape for miles. From the fringes of the headlands to fringes of the great forests -- the imposing deep woods stand vast and dense. The trees tall and leaves blotting out the great beating sun above. Animals and creatures of every form and shape bark and growl from the distant groves. Trek far enough and you will find the fain, starlight groves and paths of the twilight woods, their depths always alight with just the faintest glow of moonlight. On a great quest you may adventure further, into the harrowing, brambles of the dark woods, its depths infested with abominations of the dark. If you stand on the southern verges of the forests, you can hear a faint whining, or grinding, or screeching -- many describe it in many ways, but it is the call of the discordant plains. An ancient stone circle echoes a baying call across the plains and their is no respite from it on the plains. To the east is the towering spine of Mist -- the south east mountains. Only passable by three harrowing passes, you choose your way through: high and cold, even and deadly, or underground and spooky. The choice is in the hands of the adventurers. But choose you must, for there is no way through the sunken mountain ranges, deemed the razor peaks, that lie to the east and south and beyond them lies the great Mist shroud. If you make it through the mountains, you will find the pirate jewel of the coat. The three factions that run it are always in some sort of localized war and to enter the city is to tread carefully upon the grounds of those turf wars. If you can, a good adventurer can find anything, yes anything, within the city -- be it from the great markets or the pirate fighting league. Maybe instead of crossing the mountains, you make your way across the discordant plains, braving the mental battles you will fight there. You clamber down the cliffs of the middle steppe and across the deep, cavernous gorge that splits Mist. In the south now lies the great arid expanses of the wastes. No life, at least friendly life, lives in the desert. Good coin is paid for quality escorts for goods that are being rushed across the center of the wastes, trying to beat those that travel the rim road of the south to market. If you make it to the very bottom of the island, you find Sonderton, a harsh and efficient walled city. The rules are firm and constant, different from their northern counterparts in Gandoras. But that is all a memory to you. You stand atop the northwest cliffs, the sea breeze in your hair and the taste of salt on your tongue, and you think back fondly upon your travels. But this is only the tales of one adventurer and one journey. You must forge your path in Mist, but if you do? Your tale may just make you immortal on the pages of text. This is adventure. This is Mist. 
# A Blurb From the Author:
Mist is Ethan's creation for a dungeons and dragons campaign. It is NOT complete; what project ever is? It should feel magical and compelling. I hope to evoke my player's emotions and senses with every description I give. The cool salty breezes of the cliffsides or the hot winds of the desert, the granules of sand ripping small cuts across your exposed skin. Maybe the cold peaks of the mountains, your numb ears can hear the baying of a winter wolf far in the distance. It needs to feel alive. And it will be vibrant, in every description I narrate. - Ethan
