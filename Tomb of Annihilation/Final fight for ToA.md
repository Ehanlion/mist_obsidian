Final fight for tomb of annihilation. 

# Starting the session:

	It has been a long time since we last played through this adventure. But for your characters, not one moment has passed. You have travled through the Jungles of Chult, fought atop the great perchs of the bird people, 
	
	Aoife, Neace, Winston -- you stand before the edge of a great chasm, one familiar to Neause from a dream. Across from you is a large obsidian door, flanked by two large skulls, their tops carved out to hold blue burning candls. The walk-way to it is translucent and glowing over a whispering chasm of voiceless voices, calling out in pain. 

# DM's note for the fight:
Should have lots of cover, things to do aside from just hitting enemies, and things to find mid combat like useful potions.

#### If a player finds a potions:
Acererak is a powerful lich and a powerful alchemist.
He has a lab on the second floor where he brews unique potions. 
A player can investigate for a potion as a free action if they want.

| DC | Result |
| - | - |
| Any | A d20 is rolled, the numbers determine the results|
| Less than 5 | On a 20, a potion is found. |
| 5 to 10 | If above a 15 is rolled, a potion is found. |
| 11 to 15 | If above a 10 is rolled, a potion is found. |
| 15 and above | A potion is found. |

Refer to the [[Potions Quick Reference]] for the possible potions to be found.

#### The phylacteries:
Acererak cannot be killed if any of the phylacteries are intact.
A phylactery has an AC of 15 and 1 hit point.
Acererak heals 5 hp from every intact phylactery at the start of his turn.
There are **15 phylacteries** to start in the final cavern. 
#### The lava siphons:
There are **4 lava siphons**, one connected to each of the 4 key holes. 
They are activated with switches in the control gallery, right of entrance. Pulling the lever is difficult and requires a DC 20 athletics check to pull. Once pulled, a lever stays active as long as its held.

When active, a lava siphon pumps lava along a channel in the ground to the key hole on the Soulmongerer. The Lava superheats the lock allowing the key to be used. 

**One lava siphon is broken:** its diverter at the top that would normal direct lava towards the channel to melt the lock is missing. It is on the second level, covered under some tools and canvas rags. 
#### Destroying the Soulmongerer:
First the players must activate a lava siphon for a key slot.
Then the player must insert a key using an action.
Then the lava siphon must be turned off to lock the key into position.
Once all 4 keys are locked into position like this, the players can damage it.
The Soulmongerer has an AC of 18 and 100 Hit points. 

## Lair effects: Initiative 20
1. The small lava vents erupt. DC 13 dexterity saves versus 4d6 fire damage. Half on a success.
2. Noxious vents blow sulphiric yellow gas. DC 13 constitution saves versus 4d6 poison damage. Half on a success.
3. Tremor quakes rock the grounds. DC 13 strength saving throw verus 2d6 bludgeoning damage and knocked prone. Nothing on a success. 

## The Lower Levels:
	Large caverns dominate the lower levels, in parts crystal growths rise from floor to tall ceiling, joining them. On the right of the entrance is a small lab with 4 levers in it and a small half-wall facing the center of the cavern. Off to the left of the entrance are storage crates, a work bench, and some bones. Ahead of you is a massive cyllider made from polished metal and crystal. Inside it, phantasmal souls spin and churn, letting out an eeries wailing sound. The contraption is only accessible from 4 bridges that span a massive fall to a cavern below, filled with lava. 

The Soulmongerer stands in the middle.
Bridges span the lava pools below to the Soulmongerer.
The lava is 6o feet below. 
To the right of the Soulmongerer is the [[Atropal]].
To the left of the Soulmongerer are two beings, one short, one broad.
 - These are the princes.
 - There are two of them
 - Mazur has a large two-handed sword
 - Azon has a 

## The Upper Levels:
	As you round the corner, a large stone archway leads to a small stair case with roughly cut stones. It leads upwards in massive blocky steps about 20 feet up. You can see reflections of bottles and alchemic equipement -- this must have been a lab for experiments. On tables are ingredients, half made potions, crate of finished potions, and strange devices. The room is open, with no barrier and overlooks the cavern below from about 20-25 feet up. 

This room has many potions hidden away in it.
It has heavy, wooden work benches that can be set aflame.
The diverter valve for the non-functioning lava siphon us up here.

# Fight Phase 1:
Acererak is not preset yet. It is just the two remaining princes and the Atropal. The moment either of the remaining princes or the Atropal sees a player with their passive perception, one of the princes will dash for the second level where there is a beacon. If activated, in 3 turns time, Acererak will arrive.

Azon will be the one to activate the beacon on the second floor. 
Mazur will move towards the party and try to stall them.
The Atropal will attack from afar. 

Once activated, the princes and the Atropal fight to defend the Soulmongerer. 

# Fight Phase 2:
Acererak has arrived.
He will start by doing everything in his power to keep the Atropal alive.
If the Atropal dies, he will in fury attempt to destroy whoever killed it.
Acererak will not leave if he is about to die.
Acererak will attempt to finish kills. 

Try to emphasize the important of using cover by making Acererak use spells that allow cover to be good against them.

Keep the fight moving, put enemies behind cover, move them up to the second level, anything to keep them alive. 

#### The bridges come down:
At some point describe how the lava begins to consume the bridges and they begin to fall apart. Jumping to the middle is now harder.
