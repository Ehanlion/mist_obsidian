This is a great book regarding the adventures of [[Ignel Valis]]. The book ends with the tragic tale of his demise as he fought an Ancient Black Dragon named [[Agnedelo the Plague-Bringer]]. The story tells the great tales of his mighty deeds. 

# The Great Draconic Fight:
The greatest of all Ignel's deeds was killing Fenrix. It was a great battle that occurred deep in [[The Umbrawood]]. It was a gruesome fight, seeing the minions of both [[Ignel Valis]] and [[Garrick Blackthorn]]
killed in the fight. In the final moments, [[Ignel Valis]] was defeated by [[Agnedelo the Plague-Bringer]] but not before striking a fatal blow to the great dragon. [[Garrick Blackthorn]] was the only person to walk away from the fight. 
#### Important Note about Garrick:
The book DOES NOT mention him by name. At no point is Garrick explicitly mentioned as Garrick. If you are reading to sort of explain events to players always refer to it as [[Ignel Valis]] and his 'Adventuring Companion' as well as their hired-hands (with adventuring company meaning Garrick). It is important to make it appear as though the two don't know each other. 

> **The Real Events:**
> Ignel and Garrick DID battle Fenrix. All of the soldiers with them DID die. However, Ignel was not killed. In fact, quite far from it. He executed Fenrix with Garrick watching, extracted his soul from his draconic form and imbued Garrick with its power. Ignel took from the hoard the shard he sought. He then told Garrick to get someone to write this book and describe how Ignel died vanquishing the dragon. This is a final middle-finger from Ignel's perspective to the unreal expectations of his fans and he hope that such a heroic deed wouldn't get people asking questions. Ignel assumed a new identity as Silvan Gile and ventured to [[The Stormlocked Frontier]] to start his next adventure.

### The Rest of the Book:
I don't know man, maybe have players that look up to Ignel *create* some of his deed that they think could have inspired them.
