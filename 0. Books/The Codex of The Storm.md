Regional Description: [[The Stormlocked Frontier]]
Subsection: Codex to summon the storm of [[The Storm Lord]]
# Description:
An ancient text that contains passages and scripture relating to [[The Stormlord]]. It is a thick, large book and the pages inside are dense and intricately inscribed with gilded text, ocean motifs, and flashing storms. It is notable that, this text, flies frankly in the face of what most devotees of [[The Stormlord]] envision. In conventional texts, [[The Stormlord]] is a chaotic neutral god, who hold dominion over the storms and seas. He bestows powers of the storm and strength to his many followers. 

This text though, is twisted and tends to describe [[The Stormlord]] as a god above other gods, preaching that his powers are beyond what other gods could muster. The texts twist his image into evil, believing that followers of other gods are beneath the graces of a lord of the seas and mighty storms and that they must bow or be destroyed by might of storms. They see [[The Stormlord]] as a godlike sea serpent who dwells the infinite depths of the seas of Mist. These corrupted texts are obfuscated in primordial and make them impossible to read for any but the most devout of the order. The general rituals in the book are quite twisted, but written in common, to incentivize their use without clear understanding of what they do as the order hope for destruction and chaos. 
# Ritual Texts:
The book has a ritual in it that spans many pages detailing the long and arduous process of summoning [[The Calamitous Typhoon]], the prophesized storm of [[The Stormlord]]. The texts show violent images of shifting storms attacking the coasts of Mist. On pages there are eyes staring back at you as you read the pages and they appear to follow you. Death and ruin befall the coasts drawn in these texts and it is clear, although easy to miss on hasty reading, that this ritual is designed for destruction and is cruel. 
# Reading the Ritual:
To read the ritual requires numerous conditions to be satisfied:
1. **Charisma:** A creature needs at least 13 charisma
2. **Alignment:** Since the ritual summons a devastating storm, your character cannot be Neutral or Lawful Good Aligned.
3. **Language:** The ritual texts can be read by anyone.
4. **Religion:** The ritual texts require, in their preamble that anyone who wishes to pursue reading them swear off all other divine influence for all of time. That means no devotion or alignment to any god, deity, or powerful being. 
# The Location of the Codex:
The codex was an ancient artifact, one that was stored in the library of [[The Blue Coat Brigade]] in [[Hope Town]]. It is a jealously guarded artifact and one that requires the utmost of confidence from [[Pavel Hard]] to be told about.
