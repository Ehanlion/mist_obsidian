# Description:
[[The Prime Deities]] are leaders and luminary creators who over power [[The Betrayer Gods]] to bring light and creation to the lands that they influence. They hold sway over the spectrum of moonlight, sunlight, truth, benevolence, protection, love, death, and all of the other beautiful facets of freedom and life in the world of Mist. While these gods have differing motives, their followers often act in alliance, ensuring survival of their creations and protection from the influence of [[The Betrayer Gods]].
