Subsection: A miscellaneous god, part of [[The Pantheon of Mist]]

*(This is a homebrewed god that J is using. This god is apart of '**The Compendium of Forgotten Secrets: Awakening**' and has been accepted as a part of Mist for this adventure.*

# Nature in Mist
[[The Storm Lord]] is a god outside of both [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]]. They stand separate from the old ranks of these gods. 

However, they are still considered a god on Mist. Groups pray to [[The Storm Lord]] in forms of ritualistic cults, or rarely, individuals who seek unorthodox power ([[Wake Tiraus]] for instance). *A great storm in the name of [[The Storm Lord]] can be summoned by use of [[The Codex of The Storm]], and ancient ritual text.* The mechanics of this are detailed in the codex file. 
##### A shifting appearance:
The storm lord appears in a form that a creature believes in. That is to say, it is different for each creature that seeks power in this way. [[The Storm Lord]] is **simply a collective of power**; its goal is to **assimilate the soul of powerful champions** into its every growing embrace. Of course, [[The Storm Lord]] still embodies the storm, so this visage is usually related to storms, the sea, or monsters of the sea. 
##### A connection to Mist, broken:
[[The Storm Lord]] no longer exists in form or in influence on Mist. People still *believe in it*. However, this does not make its presence on Mist real. Just like [[The Prime Deities]] or [[The Betrayer Gods]], no physical nor mental connection can be made. *Visions seen with [[The Storm Lord]] speaking are simply the **Weave** working its way into a form in the head of the vision-seer.*
