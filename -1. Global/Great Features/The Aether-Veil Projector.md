# Description:
A massive device created by [[The Many]] and controlled by the [[Shards]] (keys). It is a magical generator that projects a screen of mist to hide the island of Mist. 
# The layers of the veil:
The veil projects as layers of mist. There are increasingly colder, denser, and darker layers of the veil that are encountered the further one tries to sail into the veil. In the coldest layers live [[Frost-Bound Wardens]]. 

This phenomenon is known to the local people of Mist as [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]. 

If you manage to sail through the incredible cold and the [[Frost-Bound Wardens]], you actually emerge on the opposite side of the island from where you entered. 
# How it works:
The Aether-veil Projector required multiple, massive components to get it functioning: a control mechanism and a power source.

**The Controls:**
The Aether-Veil Projector is controlled by [[The Mist Codex]], a computer-like interface that requires all 8 of the [[Shards]] (called keys by [[The Many]]) to be controllable. The interface allows users, once all 8 [[Shards]] have been placed into their sockets, to modify the behavior of the projector, in turn, modifying the behavior of [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]. It also has the power to modify the number of [[Frost-Bound Wardens]] and their behavior. 

It can also be used to modify spells, and spell energy itself. It can imbue schools of magic with untold power and even block entire schools of magic from having their spells cast. 

**The Power Source:**
The Aether-Veil Projector required massive amounts of [[Stormphrax]] to be fully powered. [[The Many]] spent years manipulating lightning strikes with [[Archaic Storm Conduits]], quarrying the resulting lighting spires, and extracting [[Stormphrax]]. 
## A Finite Lifespan
The projector has a finite limit in the length of time it can project for before needed to be repowered. Soon, at a time that would be good narratively for a story here, the project can begin to falter. When this happens, after a set amount of time, the projector will fail, [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]] will fall as a consequence
