# Chris's Character. 

Kelswin Lovejoy is an 18 year old Satyr.
Kelswin does not know his real parents, and was instead adopted by his step-mother [[Vivian Lovejoy]], who he treats as his complete mother because of his deep bond with her. 

[[Vivian Lovejoy]] is a librarian in a small town in [[The North-West Highlands]].
Kelswin was dropped off at the doorstep to the library as a mere infant and never knew who his parents were.

[[Vivian Lovejoy]] knows some minor magic and she taught Kelswin from a young age.
Kelswin loved the cool, tiny magic Vivian could do and would beg her to teach him. 
Kelswin is studios and academic; he would've like to study like a bookworm from the library, learning stories, spell treatises, and the history of Mist.
He loves the stories of great adventurers in particular, one being [[Ignel Valis]].

Kelswin writes letters to his mother to stay close to her.
He always tells her what town he will be in next so that she can send a letter there for him.

### Character traits of Kelswin:
These are things I was talking to Chris about to make sure I have the demeanor of Kelswin locked down. 
- Studios and academic, loves to learn
- book smart NOT street smart
- Innocent and ignorant
- Happy-go-lucky
- optimistic, almost to a fault
- Always tries to see the good in things
- generally trusting (goes back to the innocent and ignorant part)
- VERY bad at lying and keeping secrets
- Loves heroic adventure books, followed by mystery books
- Wants to be the Samwise to someone Frodo (in a small way). He wants to help great adventurers succeed and work with them. 

Work something in from his love of books as a lore element.
He might get tricked for being too trusting.

### Why Divination magic:
Kelswin loves that the heroes in the books seemed to be fated to win. He recognized them as stories, but was driven by the thought of "could I make that a reality?"

# Chris's Goals:
- Maybe Kelswin will find his real parents in the wilds and confront them.
- Large scale mysteries and intrigue
- Make note-taking VERY rewarding, map navigating from note-taking
- Role-play Role-play Role-play
- Want Kelswin's optimism to be challenged. Seeing generally hard to stomach things.
# Kelswin's Goals
- Kelswin wants to have stories written about him.


# Chris's Critique on ToA:
- Setup of Tinder as the Red dragon as an enemy that the party knew about for a long time, learned about, and were scared by and that as an enemy, Tinder was important to a beloved NPC
	- Tinder was very high payoff which hurt the impact of the rest of the campaign
	- She was separate from 'the main villain' which hurt the overall adventure.
	- Enemies should ties into other enemies to keep the search and anticipation going between massive combats.
