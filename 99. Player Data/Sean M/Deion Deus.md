# Sean's Character

Wants to be chaotic neutral, not a villain but from a rough and tumble area.
Maybe raised within [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] that patrol the middle mountain pass Wanted to please them, uses his brawn to win favor.
When Deion was younger, being a marauder was his life. He owned the pass and was proud to be a member of the tribe.
Revered amidst the tribe as all brawn no brains.
He ENJOYED the tribe while he was in it.
- Maybe he has a peer or mentor in the tribe that he still reveres as being friendly.
- Deion has a friend in the marauders. He would've been a mischievous person, friendly with Deion because he was funny and they were the same age. 
	- This friends name is [[Puck Galewind]] 
	- ETHAN -> ADD STUFF FOR THIS FRIEND
	- Maybe make them a higher up, aligned with the tribe leaders. 
	- He needs to encounter Deion maybe on a recruiting mission and he needs to be friendly, but his company needs to be distinctly dislikable and evil like the marauder's leader. 


Deion was young, around 16 when this happened.
Deion was ordered to do a terrible act ON HIS FIRST MAJOR MISSION. This was his first REAL confrontation with a caravan in the tribe. 
Pivotal movement, told to take down a caravan, upon seeing it, mostly women and children, was ordered to take it down. Hesitated because they were innocent and they were children. He remembers that he too was one of those children. 
Tribe leader ordered the killing because it came to light that the caravan was owned by an old enemy to the tribe leader and he was willing to kill them all just to make a point with them.
Deion stepped in to stop a tribe member from attacking, caused harm to a tribe member, would've been disciplined, he left with the caravan.
- This could be a fun thing to tie into another character. Maybe another character's parent was in that caravan that Deion saved. 
Wake up moment, rose colored lenses to the tribes misdeeds.
