Probably [[The South-West Arid Expanse]] would be ideal for slug considering the make weapons as trade and also started off on a fishing boat. 

**Backstory in the South-West:**
Had a family, mother and father in a fishing village.
Mother and father left the village he was from, called [[Bellmawr]]
- Slug stayed behind and parents knew Slug was good at making daggers so they left him in good graces, knowing that he could pursue his passion.
- Slug's mother is named [[Leah Stoll]] and is living in [[The Deep Woods]].
- Slug's father is named [[James Stoll]] and is currently in [[Hope Town]].
- Parents left when you were 18, giving him 3 years of dagger crafting experience.
Slug stayed in the village and grew his talent for daggers, learning from local craftsmen.
Slug is still a novice dagger smith. 

Slug would make daggers for trade and sail with his crew up the coast to market. 
Proficient with smithing tools after learning in depth his trade from [[Master Smith Claudia]]. 
# Slug's Pantheon:

# Jackson's Goals:
- Liked the dynamic map design and crazy environments for combats. Liked the Tinder fight from Tomb of Annihilation.
- Like both combat and role play.
- Like having things that can be interacted with to help the party in weird situations e.g. there being a minecart that you can turn upside down to give yourself cover, that sort of thing. 
- Changing the rules of the game by making combat diverse and different. Rule out the one solution that was working mid-combat to make the party think on the fly about a better solution.
# Slug's Goals:
- Take his trade, specifically smithing daggers, and expand it to different weapon's crafting. 
- Working with weapon's artisans to learn new techniques. 
- Make communication with his parents. Slug doesn't know where his parents are but he wants to have one day where he meets up with them before they part their separate ways. 

#### Added during play:
- Slug has a book, rented for 5 sp a day from [[Vivian Lovejoy]], about beginner wood chiseling.
