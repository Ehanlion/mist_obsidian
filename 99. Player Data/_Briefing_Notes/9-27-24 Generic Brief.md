# General Catch-up
Welcome back to Mist adventurers! I, your loving GM, am so very glad that you are back to continue playing in the lands of Mist. Let's recap where we have travelled so far. Our adventure began upon the North-West Highlands, named The Whitecliff Plateau. This is the north-western region of the lands of Mist and is overseen by the massive capital of Gandoras City. Its ruler, King Hyranthara of the Royal Seat of Stone, oversees the kingdom of Whitecliff. That's the kingdom we're in now! The tall cliffs, for which the region is named, circle the plateau, isolating the citizens of Whitecliff from The Harmonious sea to the West and The Distant Sea to the North. Whitecliff Plateau is dominated by fishing as its main trade with each of the 7 larger towns having its own, unique way to fish off of the namesake massive white cliffs of the region. Don't be taken unawares adventurer, these seas harbor danger; sea monsters, serpents, great fish, and krakens dwell here. Not to mention the tall cliffs of mist beyond the seas, off in the far distance. In legend, none have ventured beyond the mists and lived to tell the tale for these are the feared Shrouds of the Frost Bound Wardens, in which you have seen strange motions of colossal stone arms. 

That is all a bit much though, for we started in a simple fishing village along the Plateau named Saddleport, the home of Kelswin Lovejoy (an intrepid Divination Wizard Satyr). In the early days, we met the innocent folks of Saddleport: Herbert and Alice Shaw, Burton the Cowhand, Betty the Bull, Jordan Leabrook, and Vivian Lovejoy, Kelswin's adopted mother. Soon the rest of our party met: Wake Tiraus, a secretive adventurer from the South-Easternly Stormlocked Frontier and Deion Deus, an employed hand-at-arms for The Gandoras Trades Guild with a mysterious past. 

Our newborn party set off to the town of Smearsburrow, up the coast, to investigate rumors of vanishings. Uncovering rumors of a raiding party, comprised of Sahuaguin, targeting Librarians and Miners, the party rushed back to Saddleport to defend the town from an imminent raid. While valiant in there defense, tragically the party was defeated at the hands of the raiders and Vivian Lovejoy was taken as captive. The party lived through a dealing made with Yugo Stolid, an "innocent" shop keep in Saddleport, for which Deion will one day pay dearly. The investigation ensued and the party made headway for Smearsburrow and Gullhook.

In Smearsburrow the party used a majestic ship (a rundown repair raft) to explore down the cliff-coast for sea caves, searching for clues left by the Raiders. After surviving a harrowing maelstrom at sea, the search yielded a clue in the form of a complex riddle containing fleeting clues to divinities, lost locations that must be found, and something about "keyed entry of two must be found." It was found in a cave used by the Sahuaguin. What possibly could this lead to?

Forging further up the cliff-coast, the party arrived in Gullhook, a large town filled with bright characters. The town was scarred with reminders of a battle against the Sahuaguin raid force, a battle for which Gullhook paid dearly. Exploring the town led the the Dockyard guildhall and eventually to Chugga's where the party would play intense games of ball knockers to win a large prize. Items of magic were purchased and a deal was made with Arnov Vasilov (friend to Yugo Stolid) to recover strange rocks called Mind Rocks, found in the massive crabs. The group learned more of the riddle and of clues that would take them deep into the heart of the feared High Forest, a place of mystery and caution that locals hesitate to venture into. That night Deion narrowly survived his past when meeting with Puck, an dear old friend of his. Kelswin helped to save Deion's life. Wake assassinated a target of theirs, named Dmitri, killing them while they crossed a bridge into Temple Glade and later executed another target, named Igor, while the group fought Sahuaguin within the Salvage Yards. The party took on a new member, a spontaneous and chaotic Tiefling Sorcerer named Valyra. 

In the Salvage Yards, the group gained a map that noted locations around the Whitecliff Plateau. It was taken from the meeting place of the Sahuaguin and the Followers of Alsolace. This map mentioned places like The Compound, where many of the Miners were taken, and the Stronghold, where Vivian is believed to be kept. The Compound was somewhere within the High Forests while the Stronghold was much further south. Good luck my friends!

The last we left off, the group was returning to Gullhook from the Salvage Yards, injured children in tow. The children were taken to Temple Glade by the Town Guard (wearing the white clothes of the Temple Tenders). A funeral was set to take place early the next day, commemorating the life of Dmitri, a faithful servant of the Golden God of Coin, Alsolace. Tennyson Heralds, the golden preacher of Alsolace and head of Temple Glade, preaches caution since this "Wraith of the Night" who stole away Dmitri is just a sign of darkness to come as the dark god Erstorndin rises. 

So adventurers, my beloved companions, I have missed you! Welcome! Welcome back to Mist.
