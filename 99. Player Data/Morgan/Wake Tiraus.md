# JP's Character:
Wake does not walk away from great storms, they walk into them.

She is reckless.
She is intrigued and filled with a desire to learn and know more. 

Before her awakening, she lived along the South Eastern Coast in and amidst the rough and tumble fishing villages. She was a deep sea fisher on a deep sea trawler. The crew fished for large deep sea fish and dangerous, but prized, sea creatures. Wake was known for diving into the turbulent waters to wrestle with the creature they hunt.

Wake heard about, in contiguous dealings with [[Pavel Hard]] of [[The Blue Coat Brigade]] in [[Hope Town]], about an artifact that the group coveted called [[The Codex of The Storm]]]

They had notoriety along the coast as sort of an enigma. They aren't necessarily high praised, but just known. They are called:
- The King of the Beach (earnable title later!)
- The Living Disaster

After her encounter with the Lord of Storms, she travelled the coast with new purpose at hand.
She enjoyed fighting and the corsairs, raiders, and criminals along the coast made easy targets. 
- These groups prey on those who try to make honest wages from hard work at sea. 
- They are cruel, organized, and unforgiving.

She now resides in a large city on the east coast, different parts of the city are run by different pirate lords who hold dominion over different trades and markets in the city.
Wake has friendly, business relationships with [[The Blue Coat Brigade]] and [[Pavel Hard]]. In their eyes, she is a sort of agent for them who isn't bound by the pirate codes of [[Hope Town]]. 
Wake wants to be a 'Heroic' figure to the people. 
She will work against other, more evil and cruel groups to inhibit and slow their efforts. 

What is Wake's goal:
She wants to be a hero.
She wants to be aligned with a good-er faction
She wants to be a good hero since her reputation has made people wary of her.
She wants to defy her notoriety of being 'a Living Disaster' and a sort of enigma and rise as a savior and hero of the beaches; to truly live up to her name of "The King of the Beach"

Wake's relationships:
- A hero of [[The Storm Lord]].
- Walked into the sea amidst [[The Calamitous Typhoon]].
- Lived along [[The Stormlocked Frontier]]. 
- Friendly towards [[Pavel Hard]] and [[The Blue Coat Brigade]], a pirate faction in [[Hope Town]], the largest town along [[The Stormlocked Frontier]].
- Works against [[The Dead-Tide Reapers]] and [[Fedorov's Legion]].

Fun stuff:
- Parts of sessions where players KNOW they cannot fight an enemy they have to use tactics to subvert the actual fight.
	- Tactics. Creating a plan and executing it. 
- General puzzles, e.g. puzzle rooms
- general mystery
# Languages:
Wake knows:
1. Common
2. Aquan
3. Primordial
#### Added during play:
- Wake is hunting two members of [[Fedorov's Legion]], named [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]], for their crimes of murder against [[The Blue Coat Brigade]]. Wake was given 90 gp from [[Pavel Hard]] for this mission and also got a black riding horse from [[Gandoras City]]. 
- Wake was hunting the Big Red Fish in [[Smears-burrow]], alongside two Grung named Earl and Frill. Wake is a risk taker and even though this was a match that would not swing their way, they were willing to risk their lives for it. Demonstrates both bravery and recklessness in Wake's character. 
#### Ideas:
Wake could be used by [[Ignel Valis]] ([[Silvan Gile]]) as a power source for an incredibly risky spell (use 9th level from COFSA), aimed at opening a portal to the planes. This attempts to breach [[The Divine Barrier]]. This will fail. It will kill wake. It will annihilate [[The Stormlocked Frontier]] and [[Hope Town]]. 
#### Things I wanted to bring up:
1. Love the rp, just would love it if you let me know if you're wanting to change or include big elements to it so I can plan accordingly 
2. Bring physical character sheet
### Desires for future session
1. A mission that's longer winded, forced to use short rests
2. long dungeon requiring tactical usage of rest and resources
