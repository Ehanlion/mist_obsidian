[[The Bog Beast Swamps]]

Talking over patron ideas:
- celestial
- Keep Kiro believing that the celestial is 100%
- View the woman of the woods as a positive things
- But the women of the woods, much like other patrons is NOT 100% good, and this fact is something we can introduce and create as a barrier that Kiro has to overcome in their journey

Working on a name for Kiro's people:

Kiro's Family:
- Kiro's family are the leaders of the town
- Mother and Father both living and leading the town

The Slavers:
- Kiro's father was enslaved once and forced into a pact with anyone the slavers they could find, happened to be The woman of the woods who had a partially kind heart, granting Kiro's father slightly above average powers
- A more powerful group that was "testing"
- The more powerful group is [[Fedorov's Legion]]
- This "testing" was a form of using the slaves as a source to make their own legions of more powerful slaved soldier from
- So they were using this pact to trade off whatever, we don't care about slaves, to make the soldiers stronger
- Hence there being a dark side to the Woman of the Woods
- Kiro's father had more power and was able to escape
