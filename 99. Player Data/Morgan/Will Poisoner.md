# Mechanics
Rogue 1 + Artificer 3
## Item Ideas
Cool quick-load crossbow that can load poisons through poisoner's kit but can load multiple poisons in order. Like load poison 1, poison 2, poison 3 in order and then they have to be fired in that order. 

A poison that comes from the upper, runoff districts of [[Gandoras City]] that could have inspired early creations of poisons. 

Mechanics introduction is how to apply poisons, how long a poison actually lasts. 
# Backstory Ideas
I've just expanded
apothecary/alchemist who works as a healer in a slum and tries to help those who cant afford clerical healing
believes in actual medicine over magical
and for whatever reason, perhaps the price that some gods followers charge
despises that god
in general has distaste, but has a specific vendetta against one
and so
rather than just
achieving a way to kill that god
focuses on poisoning
to make that god suffer
and their ideal is to create the most powerful poison

I love that, super cool approach to apothecary-style versus magical-style healing. I think that would be a really unique approach to playing a character.

an eternal, incurable agony
that no healing can fix
so to like ironically fuck with their payment based clerical healing shit

Kind of? maybe like growing up before they succeeded in their remedies they lost people in their community to ailments that the church could've easily cured but wouldn't unless they were paid
## Where to be from
Easy idea to describe it is Zaun versus Piltover 
Obviously different than that

[[Gandoras City]] would be great starting point
**Emphasis on slum district versus wealthy district.**

Beyond the level of expense, that the poor cannot afford be it through trade or money.
Lower society relies on trading more than gold.
There is a distaste and negative attitude from the upper class to the lower class, so those clerics even if the lower folks could afford the treatments they wouldn't be given them.

Interest in meeting an NPC from the higher society, that isn't 100% evil and can act as a foil to the greedy clerics. 
The idea that the higher clerics, and how they show their god, are not better than the lower class.
Character motivation to prove themselves, and the lower class people, and that they can do great acts just as those supposedly-great clerics can. 
## My Ideas for Future Development
Great roleplay on that, since the Gods *are not present* in the world, that an eventual realization is that these clerical healers, who charge huge sums of money for precious healing, are acting on what *they think* are the tenants of the gods. However, these premises, these acts of charging sums of money and vast greed, are not truly the tenants of the gods but rather how those tenants have been twisted by those cult-like healers. 

This could lead to an awesome realization that, "hey, the Gods are not present and what keeps their powers alive is the believers who *interpret their powers!*" This would show the greedy healers in a new light and the god in a new light so I could lead this character to realization that way.
