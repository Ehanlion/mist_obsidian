**Preface:** A letter to [[Kiro Rikshaha]] from your father. It is written in his hand, scrawly and rough. Some parts are hard to read from the weathering of the note itself. You have borne it a long distance from your home in [[The Bogbeast Swamps]].

Dear Kiro,

My son, I wish you well upon your journey. A tide of darkness, like the sea waves that roll upon a distant shore, has spilled out from the bosom of [[The Umbrawood]]. The machinations of the [[The Umbral Cabal]], those meddling Devils, are soon to run amuck on the reaches of [[Mist]]. For what reason, I do not know. Seek truth Kiro. The spirits has been restless and dark aberrations of [[The Umbrawood]] are far too eager for my liking. The tribe stands strong in the face of this. Take your knowledge, your kindred spirit, and your connection and tread upon the naked soils of [[Mist]]. Find truth and reason amidst the chaos. Carry with you the Woman of the Woods and remember your home. Seek out [[The Whitecliff Plateau]], for this seems to be where these spirts run most rampant. Find a reason why dark tidings seem so impossible to avoid. There will be danger, you will be tried, but my Son, you are of my blood. You shall persist. 

Your Father.
