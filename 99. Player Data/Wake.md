# JP's Character:

Wake walked did not walk away from the storm, she walked into it. Compelled she stole a dinghy and rowed with all her might past the breakers out into the rough sea. 

She battled the seas but the dinghy was overcome and as she sank into the cold ocean waves, carried by the ripping under-currents, she came face to face with the ethereal visage of a great sea titan. A legendary eel of transcendental nature. The Storm Lord, on his passage past Mist bringing with him the storm of the century ([[The Calamitous Typhoon]]).

When wake revered the storm, she was entranced not scared and ventured into the rough seas unphased. When she came face to face with the titanic eel, she was not scared and He took her into his vision, into his grasp and she become one with his champions, a chose of The Storm Lord.
She is reckless.
She is intrigued and filled with a desire to learn and know more. 

Before her awakening, she lived along the South Eastern Coast in and amidst the rough and tumble fishing villages. She was a deep sea fisher on a deep sea trawler. The crew fished for large deep sea fish and dangerous, but prized, sea creatures. Wake was known for diving into the turbulent waters to wrestle with the creature they hunt.

She has notoriety along the coast as sort of an enigma. She isn't necessarily high praised, but just known. She is called:
- The King of the Beach
- The Living Disaster

After her encounter with the Lord of Storms, she travelled the coast with new purpose at hand.
She enjoyed fighting and the corsairs, raiders, and criminals along the coast made easy targets. 
- These groups prey on those who try to make honest wages from hard work at sea. 
- They are cruel, organized, and unforgiving.

She now resides in a large city on the east coast, different parts of the city are run by different pirate lords who hold dominion over different trades and markets in the city.
She is friendly to the most reasonable group, favoring a human organization who are at the very least, lawful and humane.
Wake wants to be a 'Heroic' figure to the people. 
She will work against other, more evil and cruel groups to inhibit and slow their efforts. 

What is Wake's goal:
She wants to be a hero.
She wants to be aligned with a good-er faction
She wants to defy her notoriety of being 'a Living Disaster' and a sort of enigma and rise as a savior and hero of the beaches; to truly live up to her name of "The King of the Beach"
