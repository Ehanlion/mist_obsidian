I have used underscores in the name of this file to float it at the top of the player data folder to make sure it doesn't get mingled with all of the player document below.
# Note from Ethan:
I have the desire that, if at any point in my life, I become unable to continue my GM work for my player group, one of my players inherits my position as GM and continues the adventure for the party.

My players are JP, Chris, Jackson, and Sean. My first candidate would be Chris since I know he has been a GM for his own group for a good time now and from what I hear, he does an excellent job. My second candidate would be Sean to give him a chance to become a GM like he once told me he wanted to. 

My other desire is that, when this vault is inherited, the group continues to play with an NPC named Pud. Pud would be a Totem Warrior Barbarian wielding a Great-Axe with the Great Weapons Master feat. That way, if I ever make my return to play with the group, I would have my beloved Pud to play.
