Combined with my ideas from before: Inescapable doom: endless pursuit by an Ancient Greatwyrm
- I was on a deadly mission to hunt a Young Red Greatwyrm that was threatening the forest (forest fire bad)
- The Mother Red Greatwyrm is very well attuned to and adept with magic and knew I was from [[The Green Order]]
- I struck the final blow on the Young Greatwyrm and nearly escaped death, making me the main target of the Mother Ancient Greatwyrm
- Somehow I evaded the tracking of the Mother Greatwyrm, but I knew it would continue to follow me
- If it followed me into the [[The Starwoods]] and made it to [[The Green Order]], it would burn everything to the ground out of retribution, killing my loved ones
- I ran straight to the [[The Umbrawood]], found [[The Darkfire Sanctum]] and the Devils of [[The Umbral Cabal]]
- I signed a contract with a Devil named [[Kilvaroth]] stating that *The Mother Greatwyrm would not chase me or instigate a fight with [[The Green Order]]*
- To do this, the contract described a complex re-bending of the weave itself to disguise my sorcerous, magical scent to the mother greatwyrm, since the mother greatwyrm can smell my magic
- Thus my magic would be augmented with chaos and everything good would smell bad
