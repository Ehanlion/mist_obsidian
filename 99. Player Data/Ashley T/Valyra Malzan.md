Likes the forest
# Beginning Character Ideas
- Loves playing Tiefling
- Ideas on class: Leaning into magic forest vibe,  
	- Half caster non used are Paladin Ranger
	- Full caster non used as Sorcerer and Bard 
- Locked in on *Sorcerer*
- We are looking at a *Tiefling Sorcerer*
## Rolling Stats
- 5d6 D2L for one
- 4d6 D1L for two
- 3d6 for three
- Allocate as you wish between stats
- Rolls
	- 15, 15, 13, 9, 12, 11 
- Hit die rolls
	- 6 (base), 5, 4, 3 (add your Con modifier to each)
## Wild Magic Info
- Add some Devil-themed stuff to Wild Magic Table
- Devil-mechanic, where the likelihood of starting a surge increases 
- If you act a certain way, or do certain deed (think oath breaker paladin), then your magic more volatile or something. 
# Background Ideas
- Going to be from [[Gullhook]] for sure
- Ideas:
	- Tie to Hunter's Guild and [[The Green Order]] 
	- Tie to [[Gideon Southmellow]] in [[Gullhook]] and the Salvage Yards?
- What Ashley is thinking:
	- Tying in the subrace a little bit
	- Levistus Tiefling, offers bargains to those who face an inescapable doom
	- Devil's Bargains
- Ethan's Add on:
	- There a place, a casino or hideaway or a den of Devils, and it's locked away, in secret, deep within [[The Umbrawood]]. 
	- [[The Umbrawood]] are within, and to far east part of [[The Wildwoods]] 
	- The place with a lot of [[Yugo Stolid]]'s friends? That's this place in the forests. 
- **So working on this:**
	- Ashley will work on the inescapable doom part
		- Question about bargaining the Devil, have to actually go to the Devil to make a deal
		- Wounded in forests on mission from [[The Green Order]], stumbled upon the den of the Devils and forced to make a deal to salvage life?
		- Powers before or after talking to devils? Before = needed skill to be in [[The Green Order]] but the deal with the Devil's almost corrupted your powers causing you to turn unstable and volatile with magic. 
	- But The Devil's Hideaway, will be a key moment where Ashley's character makes a deal with one of the higher up devils in the Hideaway. 
	- After making the deal with The Devil tries to go back and be part of order normally, but tragedy strikes! During a mission, a wild magic surge kills, against her will, two of her companions outright. The order realized the nature of the magic, and as such resents her for choosing a path they see as corrupt. They exile her, and on pain death may she set foot in [[The Starwoods]] again. 
	- Character outcast [[The Green Order]], never to be allowed back in again ([[The Green Order]] hates the Devils ... )
	- Also means, in [[Gullhook]], you DO NOT get along with the Hunter's Guild because they are directly attached to the [[The Green Order]]. 
	- Need a reason to be up in [[Gullhook]]
	- Something about the character having a permanent affliction that they had to make the deal with the Devil for and that always is kind of not perfect and reminds them of why they had to make the deal.  
## Flair Descriptions
- flavor magic and interactions fueled by the Devil patron as fiery and hot
- flavor magic and casting and abilities from [[Valyra Malzan]] as cold because of Levistus Tiefling stuff. 
# Motivations
- To prove oneself
- Or to get revenge
- Ashley will think on this
# Stuff From Ashley
**Questions Ashley had:**
- how/why do people join the green order?
    - demonstrate great ability with forests, druidcraft
    - typically only admit rangers, druids, and SOME sorcerers OR you are born into it OR asylum offered to kids (can get kicked out)
- do people in the green order live in the deep forest?
- people that hate the green order (hate me, but could be able to bargain given I have broke the bond with Green Order and now affiliated with :
    - Iron First Marauders: control the blood stone pass, the middle pass through the south east mountains, generally brutal and brutish, branded with a mark of the pass on their body
    - The Syndicate of Ice: dark and cruel, reclusive masters of the Cold Road, the highest and most deadly pass through the South East mountains
    - Fedorov's Legion: evil pirate faction in Hope town, largest town on south east coast

born into green order, family disowned after devil contract with Kilvuzeth and only one friend (druid tiefling) gave them the option of refuge with their relatives in Gullhook

| What are my people like           | Mainly druids and rangers, relatively secretive (Green Order is an exclusive organization). They are close knit and look out for each other due to the danger of the Twilight Woods                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Opinion of homeland               | Dislike it, reminds me of traumatic events and the betrayal from family and friends. Not to mention its a dangerous place for solo adventurers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Friends                           | Caigwyn: female tiefling prodigious druid, 25 y/o, joined Green Order as a child (in order to further hone impressive skills) and grew up with me. We went on many missions together and played often as children, so we are close. Her family is not in the Green Order, so she was raised by my family in the basecamp. After I was exiled from the Green Order, she tells me the location of her family’s home in Gullhook so that I could have a safe place to rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Since you struck the final blow to this infant dragon, a wyrmling, the greatwyrm marked you as its enemy for life. It slaughtered many within the order who took that mission and you escaped, ending up at the Devil's lair** |
