## Wild Magic Info
- Add some Devil-themed stuff to Wild Magic Table
- Devil-mechanic, where the likelihood of starting a surge increases 
- If you act a certain way, or do certain deed (think oath breaker paladin), then your magic more volatile or something. 
# Background Ideas
- Going to be from [[Gullhook]] for sure
- Ideas:
	- Tie to Hunter's Guild and [[The Green Order]] 
	- Tie to [[Gideon Southmellow]] in [[Gullhook]] and the Salvage Yards?
- What Ashley is thinking:
	- Tying in the subrace a little bit
	- Levistus Tiefling, offers bargains to those who face an inescapable doom
	- Devil's Bargains
- Ethan's Add on:
	- There a place, a casino or hideaway or a den of Devils, and it's locked away, in secret, deep within [[The Dark Woods]]. 
	- [[The Dark Woods]] are within, and to far east part of [[The Deep Woods]] 
	- The place with a lot of [[Yugo Stolid]]'s friends? That's this place in the forests. 
- **So working on this:**
	- Ashley will work on the inescapable doom part
		- Question about bargaining the Devil, have to actually go to the Devil to make a deal
		- Wounded in forests on mission from [[The Green Order]], stumbled upon the den of the Devils and forced to make a deal to salvage life?
		- Powers before or after talking to devils? Before = needed skill to be in [[The Green Order]] but the deal with the Devil's almost corrupted your powers causing you to turn unstable and volatile with magic. 
	- But The Devil's Hideaway, will be a key moment where Ashley's character makes a deal with one of the higher up devils in the Hideaway. 
	- After making the deal with The Devil tries to go back and be part of order normally, but tragedy strikes! During a mission, a wild magic surge kills, against her will, two of her companions outright. The order realized the nature of the magic, and as such resents her for choosing a path they see as corrupt. They exile her, and on pain death may she set foot in [[The Twilight Woods]] again. 
	- Character outcast [[The Green Order]], never to be allowed back in again ([[The Green Order]] hates the Devils ... )
	- Also means, in [[Gullhook]], you DO NOT get along with the Hunter's Guild because they are directly attached to the [[The Green Order]]. 
	- Need a reason to be up in [[Gullhook]]
	- Something about the character having a permanent affliction that they had to make the deal with the Devil for and that always is kind of not perfect and reminds them of why they had to make the deal.  
## Flair Descriptions
- flavor magic and interactions fueled by the Devil patron as fiery and hot
- flavor magic and casting and abilities from [[Valyra Lastname]] as cold because of Levistus Tiefling stuff. 
# Motivations
- To prove oneself
- Or to get revenge
- Ashley will think on this
