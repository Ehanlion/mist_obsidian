Potion making is a complex task. Here are the core components a player needs:
1. A potion making level
2. Proficiency in harvesting tools e.g. Alchemist's, Poisoner's, or Herbalism kit.

### Potion level:
Every player has a potions level. Unless trained in potion making by an expert, this level is zero. There are 10 levels, each level increasing a player bonus that they get when making potions. 

#### Levelling-up Potion level:
You can get experience for gathering ingredients and crafting potions successfully. Here are the experiences values:
>**Experience from foraged and harvested ingredients:**
>Every time you harvest a new ingredient you gain experience *per ingredient* that you harvest. That's to say if you find a cluster and harvest 5 flowers, you get 5 times the experience.
>- Common: 2 exp 
>- Rare: 10 exp
>- Legendary: 25 exp

> **Experience from crafting potions:**
> Every time you craft a new potion you gain experience according to the potions level. You have to successfully craft the potion to gain the experience.
> - Common: 50 exp
> - Rare: 350 exp
> - Legendary: 700 exp
#### Experience needed to level-up
There are 10 levels of potions crafting, with people starting at level 0. Each level increases the modifier you get to apply to potion crafting and ingredient harvesting rolls. 
> **Experience level:**
> - Level 0: 0 exp, Prof. +0
> - Level 1: 150 exp, Prof: +1
> - Level 2: 450 exp, Prof: +2
> - Level 3: 900 exp, Prof: +3
> - Level 4: 1500 exp, Prof: +4
> - Level 5: 2250 exp, Prof: +5
> - Level 6: 3150 exp, Prof: +6
> - Level 7: 4200 exp, Prof: +7
> - Level 8: 5400 exp, Prof: +8
> - Level 9: 6750 exp, Prof: +9
> - Level 10: 9500 exp, Prof: +10

## Actually using this:
**Harvesting**: First examine the area using a perception, investigation, or whatever check is appropriate. Then roll a d20 and add your tool proficiency and potion making proficiency.

**Crafting**: First input a number of gold required for the potion. Then spend the time to craft the potion. At the end roll a d20 and add your tool proficiency and potion making proficiency. 

Tool proficiency means adding your proficiency bonus from being able to use either Alchemists, Herbalists, or Poisoners tool kits. You NEED proficiency in the tool required to make a potion to be able to make it. Any tool kit can be used to harvest, but you still need proficiency with it.
