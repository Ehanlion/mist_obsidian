Potion making is a complex task. Here are the core components a player needs:
1. A potion making level
2. Proficiency in harvesting tools e.g. Alchemist's, Poisoner's, or Herbalism kit.

Base System that this slimmed system is modelled on:  [Potion's Website](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MNG6P6I8-1tJM3aroaV)

# Potion level:
Every player has a potions level. Unless trained in potion making by an expert, this level is zero. There are 5 levels, each level increasing a player bonus that they get when making potions. 
#### Levelling-up Potion level:
You can get experience for gathering ingredients and crafting potions successfully. Here are the experiences values:
>**Experience from foraged and harvested ingredients:**
>Every time you harvest a new ingredient you gain +1 experience.

> **Experience from crafting potions:**
> Every time you successfully craft a potion, you get +5 experience.
#### Experience needed to level-up
There are 5 levels of potions crafting, with people starting at level 0. Each level increases the modifier you get to apply to potion crafting and ingredient harvesting rolls. 
> **Experience level:**
> - L0: 0 exp, Prof +0
> - L1: 8 exp, Prof +1
> - L2: 32 exp, Prof +3
> - L3: 128 exp, Prof +5
> - L4: 512 exp, Prof +7
> - L5: 2048 exp, Prof +10
> - Prestige: Keep tracking exp past L5.
> 
> *The experience scales at a multiple of 4x starting from level 1 since the original system has 10 levels and that's too many.*

# Finding Ingredients:

Foraging and collecting means searching through the environment and Harvesting ingredients means collecting them carefully from a creature that is dead (or alive if you are sneaky).

**Making checks to forage for ingredients:**
You can make checks with Perception, Investigation, Nature, or Survival. It is a purely whichever the player prefers. This gives them a greater chance of actually finding ingredients. You can describe the process differently depending on the checks:
- Nature would mean remembering something from your learnings about your environment and searching for it using clues of the setting. 
- Survival would draw on your primal instincts to hunt and gather and be a core reaction to foraging that you have trained to lead you in the correct direction.
- Perception would be carefully looking through the scenery to pick out even the smallest details.
- Investigation would be getting down and dirty and looking for every possible clue in the nearby area to lead you to whatever ingredients you could find. 

It takes 30 minutes everytime you search for ingredients in an area. If you find anything, harvesting them is included in this time frame.

**Making checks to harvest ingredients:**
A lot of times, you won't need to search for a harvestable unless you are not the one to have killed the creature you are trying to harvest from. Either way, this also costs 30 minutes of your time.

**TL;DR: It takes 30 minutes to forage and collect ingredients and 30 minutes to harvest ingredients from a creature source.**

# Crafting Potions:
It takes time to craft a potion and then you make a check after. The check is detailed below. I believe that every potion should take the same amount of time. We will use 30 minutes per potion to make this streamlined. A potion can be made as part of a short rest and long rest. You are limited to one potion per short rest, and 3 potions per long rest. 

It also costs gold, which varies with level: Common = 25, Rare = 100 or 400, Legendary = 850. If you fail to craft a potion, your ingredients are fully expended but you keep your gold. The gold component is only consumed if the crafting succeeds. 

TL;DR: **It takes 30 minutes and an amount of gold based on rarity to make ANY potion.**

# Actually using this:
- Character_Proficiency is your character's proficiency bonus, applied IF you are proficient with the given tool-set that you are using: Herbalist's, Alchemist's, or Poisoner's kits.
- Potion_Proficiency is your proficiency bonus from your potion making level, applied to all of these checks no matter what. 
- To **HARVEST** an ingredient you **DO NOT** have to have proficiency with the tool kit that would be used; you simply **DO NOT** add the bonus for the tool kit to the roll.
- To **CRAFT A POTION**, you **HAVE TO HAVE PROFICIENCY** with the tool kit used to craft the potion **NO MATTER WHAT**. 

**Harvesting**: First examine the area using a perception, investigation, or whatever check is appropriate. Then roll a d20 and add your tool proficiency and potion making proficiency.

	Equation: 1d20 + Character_Proficiency + Potion_Proficiency, rolled AFTER you have found an ingredient with EITHER: Investigation, Perception, Nature, or Survival.

**Crafting**: First input a number of gold required for the potion. Then spend the time to craft the potion. At the end roll a d20 and add your tool proficiency and potion making proficiency. 

	Equation: 1d20 + Character_Proficiency + Potion_Proficiency, rolled at THE END of the crafting period for the potion.
