#### Acid Dew
Like its more famous family, Honeydews, Acid Dew is a carnivorous plant, but with a stronger sting. It’s droplets dissolve its prey with a sticky acid instead of enzymes in syrup. Touching the flowers without protection forces the target to roll a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 poison damage. Surprisingly, the acid has great curative characteristics once diluted sufficiently, aiding in the closing of wounds.
