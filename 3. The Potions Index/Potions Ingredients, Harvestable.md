These are ingredients a player can harvest from a creature. The creature can be alive or dead to do this, but that is more dependent on what they are trying to harvest from the creature. 

In the original system, there were 5 categories of rarities and I reduced it to just 3. You would also get different experience for each different rarity which I reduced to just the same amount of experience.
