**QNS**
- northern mountains in [[The Chromatic Fangs]]
- brutal, icy cold sheer mountains
- These are like the Pyrenees on steroids 
- All three passes traverse this region of mountains
	- [[Gar Imladris Crossing]]
	- [[Dum Kazad Khalad Throngul]]
	- [[The Bloodstone Pass]]
	- none go through the southern mountains because in comparison, these are more passable 
- These mountains are mostly equivalent in height to climbing Everest at their lowest
- They have foothills of frozen glaciers 
- They are plagued by winds over 100 mph at their weakest
- They are plagued by snowstorms so thick you can't see the end of your nose
- and they are STILL preferred to the southern peaks of [[The Scorvorian Peaks]]
