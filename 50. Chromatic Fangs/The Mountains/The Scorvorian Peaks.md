**QNS**
- everyone in their right mind traverses [[The Frigid Crucible]] by ways of the three passes
- [[The Scorvorian Peaks]] are impassible
- You will be incinerated by the heat, the magma flows, the collapsing slopes from ancient magma tunnels, or rampaging ash storms
- Or if you are unlucky, a rare but possible fire storm will erupt from the volcanic chasms
	- these are like a reset switch to a mountain, vents erupt with flame and heat and spawn new creatures of the fire domain
	- this happens while it glassifies any of the rock with such heat that they turn to obsidian 
- if THAT doesn't kill you, the creatures of fire that dwell here will
- and if you are UNLUCKY enough that those don't kill you, [[Scorvorria the Ember Greatwyrm]] or her many, many kin, will hunt you for sport
	- she will not hunt you for food, she does not need you for food
	- she will hunt you for sport, because it is SO RARE that anyone DARES traverse these lands, that the thought of fresh prey screaming is enough to throw her into a frenzy
