**QNS**
- [[The Labyrinth of Stone]] is located under the mountains
- it connects [[The Bloodstone Pass]] and [[Gar Imladris Crossing]] and [[Dum Kazad Khalad Throngul]] via a long network of tunnels in the mountains
- it is impossible to navigate consistently 
- the paths changes,
- the labyrinth is filled with magical darkness, strange illusions, clouds of mind controlling spores, the list goes on
- if it sucks to encounter and is spooky, this has it 
- monsters live here that hunt without eye sight and rely on the other sense, most use tremor sense and detect vibrations in the ground
