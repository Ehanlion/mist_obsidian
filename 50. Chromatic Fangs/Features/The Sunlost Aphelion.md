**QNS**
- a temple at the peak of a mountain
- Can channel healing powers once per year on a solstice 
- Able to re-unite a spirit to a body from any age
- Essentially a perfect resurrection 
- Can come at a sacrifice, activate on both the "winter solstice" and the "summer solstice"
	- on summer a "good" sacrifice can be made e.g. powerful weapon or vast riches
	- on winter a "bad" sacrifice can be made e.g. blood sacrifice, death of another, and so on
- Good place to have a quest surrounding it
