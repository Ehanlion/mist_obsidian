Regional location: [[The Chromatic Fangs]]
Subsection:

This is the spookiest, most unnerving, and (deceptively) the most dangerous of the paths through [[The Chromatic Fangs]]. It is dark and spooky. It takes travelers through hallucinogenic pockets, underwater sections, and intense mental warfare. It is the least appealing choice when compare to the temperate but brutal [[The Bloodstone Pass]] and the freakishly frosty winds of [[Gar Imladris Crossing]].

**QNS**
- [[Fathomsdeep Hold]] is the ancient hold of the dwarves of [[Mist]]
- it is the only pass to go under the mountain rather than over it
- The dwarves and other mountain races are extraordinarily secretive and hide their practices closely 
	- the dwarves are mining out ancient compounds of [[The Many]] here 
	- They are search for a powerful [[Shard]] hidden deep within the mountain (according to their legends)
- The majority of the pass goes through dangerous crystal fields
- These crystal fields are vast and reach down like a massive open cave into the mountain
- It is a labyrinth and going without a guide is lethal
