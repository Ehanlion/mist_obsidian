Regional location: [[The Chromatic Fangs]]
Subsection: 

This is the highest, most treacherous (at least physically) of the passes through [[The Chromatic Fangs]]. It is higher up, far higher up, than [[The Bloodstone Pass]] and is the essential opposite to [[Dum Kazad Khalad Throngul]] in terms of the challenges one faces along both routes.

**QNS**
- the [[Gar Imladris Crossing]] is the crossing of the high fey
- This path is ruled by immortal elves and the fey creatures
- They are trained as assassins from an early age
- They accept pay, not in gold but in item sacrifices
	- you need to pay in items
	- potions, ammo, weapons
	- rarities, art, exotic food and spices
	- Things have a very fixed set price and it's not all willy nilly
	- Mundane items have a fixed cost, then magic items, then potions, then exotic foods, simple and harsh
	- This system should feel confusing and unnecessary
