Regional location: [[The Chromatic Fangs]]
Subsection: Passed high over [[The Frozen Peak]]

This is the highest, most treacherous (at least physically) of the passes through [[The Chromatic Fangs]]. It is higher up, far higher up, than [[The Bloodstone Pass]] and is the essential opposite to [[Dum Kazad Khalad Throngul]] in terms of the challenges one faces along both routes.
