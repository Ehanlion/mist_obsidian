# Description:
An Aphelion is the furthest distance a planet travels from its sun. The Sun-Lost Aphelion is a small temple atop [[Dragonswing Peak]]. Once per year, at sunrise, the sun perfectly casts light into the temple. When this happens, healing beyond anything capable of magic can occur.
# Healing from the Aphelion
The magic in the Aphelion is so great that it can rebuild a body, bring back a soul from one long past dead, or basically anything. If you have an ailment, it can be healed in the Sun-Lost Aphelion.

However, due to how isolate the temple is, few go here anymore. In fact, for over a decade the temple has not seen use on the day of great healing and people are beginning to forget about it.
# Getting to the Temple:
Few go to the temple despite its incredible power because of how hard it is to reach. There is no path to the temple and to get there requires a feat of mountaineering beyond what most are capable of. If you are experienced, it could take a week to reach the temple; if you are a novice, it could take a month. 
# The Temple Gaurdian:
Since the temple grants untold magical healing power and could bring someone evil back from the dead, it is important that the temple is guarded.

A Celestial Dragon will judge any who enter the temple. It will know your soul purpose, your alignment, and your cause without needing to ask any questions. If it judges your motives unjust, it will offer you one chance to rebuke its verdict; if you fail, it will destroy you.
