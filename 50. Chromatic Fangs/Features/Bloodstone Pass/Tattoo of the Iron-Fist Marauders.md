**The Tattoo:**
A tattoo of [[The Bloodstone Pass]] is a tattoo for life. It is magically etched into a place that will always be exposed. Most choose the backs of their necks, the fronts of the necks, their faces, or their hands since these places are hard to always cover. The tattoo itself is a gory depiction of a bloody skull set into a circlet of interconnected iron rings. The tattoo is etched in red for the blood, black for the skull, and glittering silver for the chains. The chains symbolize servitude, the skull symbolizes the presence of death, and the blood symbolizes the ichor with which you pay for your strength with your pain.
