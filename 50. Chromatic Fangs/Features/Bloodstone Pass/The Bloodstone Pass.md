Regional location: [[The Chromatic Fangs]]
Subsection: Passes over [[Slumbering Mount]]

This is the pass through the mountains that [[Garrick Blackthorn]], leader of [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] have dominion over. In the middle sits [[The Bastion of Blood]], the stronghold of the Marauders. It is the medium path through the mountains; it avoids the fearful spawns of [[Dum Kazad Khalad Throngul]] the gales and fierce weather of [[Gar Imladris Crossing]].
