Regional location: [[The Chromatic Fangs]]
Subsection:

This is the spookiest, most unnerving, and (deceptively) the most dangerous of the paths through [[The Chromatic Fangs]]. It is dark and spooky. It takes travelers through hallucinogenic pockets, underwater sections, and intense mental warfare. It is the least appealing choice when compare to the temperate but brutal [[The Bloodstone Pass]] and the freakishly frosty winds of [[The Cold Road]].
