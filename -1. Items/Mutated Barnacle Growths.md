- **Armor Class:** AC 18, separate from attached creature.
- *Ability:* If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points with a [[Mutated Barnacle Growths]], it rolls a D20. If the roll is 10 or more, the creature revives on 1 hit point. This feature can trigger any amount of times until the growth is destroyed. 
- *Surgical Removal:* A DC 18 medicine check can successfully remove a barnacle growth. However, if the  check fails, it causes 1 hit die worth of permanent damage to the creature. 
- *Forceful Removal:* A DC 20 strength check rips the barnacle off a creature. This is terrible for the creature. They make a Con save DC 20. On a fail, they take 8d8 Necrotic damage and their constitution is reduced by 1d6 indefinitely. This can be cured by greater restoration or a more powerful curing spell. On a success, they take half damage and their Con goes unreduced.
