# What are shards:
They are Keys, a part of the legacy left by [[The Many]]. Shards are what the few who even know about [[The Many]] call the ancient artifacts they imbued with power. [[The Many]] called them keys. 
# The Distinction between Shards and Keys:
In texts written by [[The Many]], the 'Shards' are called 'Keys' since that is their name to [[The Many]]. However, in any discussion outside of texts, carvings, and direct messages left by [[The Many]], 'Keys' are strictly referred to as 'Shards,' and there is no idea of the names 'Keys' known to anyone on Mist.

**Summary**:
- Citizens of Mist refer to 'Keys' as 'Shards.' Text by citizens of Mist call them 'Shards.'
- [[The Many]] refer to 'Keys' as 'Keys.' Text by [[The Many]] call them 'Keys.'
# Properties:
While the Keys are powerful artifacts, they were originally keys made by [[The Many]] to control [[The Mist Codex]] and by extension, to control [[The Aether-Veil Projector]]. Each one of [[The Many]] owning and creating a Key ensures that no single member of [[The Many]] could control any of the devices they created alone.

| Key 1 -[[Faustus]]   | In the Throne of Stone within [[Gandoras City]] and [[The Seat of Stone]].  | Appears as a large, white gem with glittering gold flakes swirling inside.        | When bound to an object worn by the user, gives incredible luck. Can choose to have advantage on a number of rolls equal to your proficiency bonus and gives the user the lucky feat.                                 | ???                                                                                                                                                  |
| Key 2 - [[Marwood]]  | Held as a prized piece by [[Ignel Valis]] and is embedded within his staff. | Appears as a small, vibrating blue ethereal key.                                  | When bound to an item of spell-caster, wielder's intelligence increases by 2.                                                                                                                                         | ???                                                                                                                                                  |
| Key 3 - [[Bernhard]] | The coveted centerpiece of the Grung's society near [[Smears-burrow]].      | Appears as a large, shimmering, conch shell with green glittering markings on it. | When blown into, it can summon a maelstrom. However if it is left in water, it cleans and purifies any water it touches as well as gives any creature living in the waters it purifies an unnaturally long life span. | A maelstrom brewing, a voice shouting frantically amidst the storms regarding 'them who are coming,' and a dissonant echoing rasping from the conch. |

Each one of [[The Many]] was responsible for creation on of the Keys. Below the creators are listed in order with the number beside the member's name corresponding to the key number in the above table.

#### The Magic Powering the Keys:
Each Key give off signatures form major schools of magic including: 
1. Abjuration
2. Divination
3. Transmutation
4. Enchantment
5. Illusion 

When keys are held by someone, they relive the memories stored within the key. Based on the memory it is appropriate to assign some save or spell that happens in the course of the flashback that must be endured to continue learning from the memory. It should be brutal and harsh. 

#### Thresholds and Memories:
For each of the keys, have a 'threshold' within the memory that requires endurance, cunning, intelligence, or might to overcome within the memory. It should be like a challenge or puzzle and each memory needs the correct choice or selection to unlock the last, most important elements of the memory. In these last potions are the most revealing and powerful elements of the memory. 

#### The Members and Key Holders:
Each member of [[The Many]] is keyed to a specific key. That key was theirs during their time on Mist and is imbued with powers for what they the wielder cherished. 
1. [[Faustus]] - Key 1
2. [[Marwood]] - Key 2
3. [[Bernhard]] - Key 3
4. [[Cleophas]] - Key 4
5. [[DeAngelo]] - Key 5
6. [[Mansfield]] - Key 6
7. [[Sprague]] - Key 7
8. [[Valentino]] - Key 8
# Memory Fragments:
Each one of the shards has inside of it, an ancient memory stored from its owner. When a creature touches the shard for the first time, or any time after that point if they concentrate, that creature can tap into the memory stored within the shard. This might be a small recollection of how the shard was used, a personal memory whilst on the island, or something more revealing about the actual usage of the shard -- you choose Ethan!

Regardless of the memory that each shard holds, it will be a memory from the member of [[The Many]] that created the key. Example: A memory stored within Key 1 would be a memory made by [[Faustus]] and it would be from their perspective.
