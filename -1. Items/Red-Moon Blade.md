# Description
A red moon blade glows with a sinister, dark red hue. Runic carvings in the blade usually depict some ceremony to do with [[The Red Moon]]. 
# Forging a Red-Moon Blade
Forging a red-moon blade requires the sacrifice of an unwilling soul and the rising of [[The Red Moon]]. The subject must be sacrificed upon a stone table within [[The Twilight Woods]], under the light of [[The Red Moon]]. The weapon used to sacrifice the subject will become a Red-Moon Blade.
# Blade Properties
1. A Red-Moon Blade retains all properties originally bestowed unto it e.g. a +1 great-sword used in the forging of a red-moon blade, retains its +1 modifier.
2. The blade rends the soul of a target it kills. If a red-moon blade reduces a target to 0 hit points and the target fails its death saving throws, its soul is eviscerated. 
3. A Red-Moon blade can be made to glow, casting dim light in a 15 ft radius of the blade.
