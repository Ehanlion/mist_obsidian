# Description:
This ring is innocuous; a simple metal band of cold metal. However it holds great power, at a great cost. A sought after item for any great caster, [[Weave-breaker Ring]]s harness gambling and the weave to roll the dice on your magic power. The more used the ring is, the more tarnished the metal appears. Fresh, unused rings are shimmering, vibrant silver metal while heavily used ones are tarnished, unpolishable rusty metal. 
# Mechanics:
- A player can channel the weave to cast a spell that they *do not have a spell slot for*. The spell must be on their spell list but can be unprepared. 
- When the player chooses to do this, they must roll a saving throw using their spell casting ability as the save type. 
- **Save DC:** 13 + The level of the spell. Increases by 1 after every usage (fail or succeed). This is *a permanent increase to the DC.* 
- **On Failure:** The creature is paralyzed until the start of their next turn in combat, or 1 minute out of combat. They suffer one level of exhaustion.
- **On Success:** The creature is able to cast the spell they were trying to cast with the spell's normal casting time. They suffer one level of exhaustion. *The rings magic becomes depleted for 24 hours.*
