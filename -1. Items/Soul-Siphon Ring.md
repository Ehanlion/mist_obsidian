# Description:
This ring can imbue its wielder with incredible physique and prowess in martial combat. You just have to give in to it. The cost? It just borrows *a teensy bit* of your living soul. Small price to pay for unbeatable power.  
# Magic Item:
- Requires Attunement
- Sentient, Chaotic Evil. Goal is to devour user's soul. Offers strength and constitution as incentive. 
- **Cursed:** Once attuned, the ring cannot be removed or unattuned from.
- **Mechanic:** Can choose to *give into the ring.* Once done, you state on a scale of *heavily resisting* to *complete submission* how strongly you wish to give into the ring. Then you save against the Ring's DC. The more you wish to give in, the harder the DC to keep your soul whole. *User makes a Charisma save **DC 6** up to **DC 20** depending on submission level*. 
	- The Benefit: Depending on your wager, your Strength and Constitution increase drastically. From a +1 in each when resisting, up to a +6 in each when submitting. 
	- The Cost: The ring temporarily consumes your **charisma, wisdom, and intelligence.** Your stats decrease relative to what you wagered. Heavily resisting may result in a small reduction and complete submission results in a score of 1 for each stat. 
	- If you **succeed** this change is purely temporary and revert back to your original score. 
	- If you **fail** this change is *mostly* temporary. The ring consumes 1 stat point *permanently* from each stat. There is no way to retrieve this. 
	- **Not submitting ever:** if you fail to submit to the ring for more than a week, the user must make a DC 20 Charisma save. On a fail, their max hit points are reduced by one hit die and they lose 1 point from intelligence, wisdom, and charisma permanently.
