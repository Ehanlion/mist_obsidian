Preface: The party failed. Something they did caused a great evil to be born, to file unchecked into the world. The party could not stop it. All hope seems lost until a new, ancient solution slowly presents itself. A daring dive back to the past to save their failed adventure. 

The mission:
-  Some ancient gate way exists. It is a large stone door in the shape of large stone circle. It is missing pieces however.
-  Gathering pieces to the gate will allow for its completion:
	-  A keystone with chronology runes inscribed on it
	-  A large stone dial, inset into the ground before the stone circle
	-  The ritual, broken into pieces scattered on ancient stone tablets. There are 3.
-  Going into the past will allow the party to be in the same time as their past selves. The can influence themselves, but if seen could cause a crazed madness.
-  At the point they depart from present to past through the gateway, will be the point where their timelines merge. Until then the party must exist together with their past selves on their timeline. There is no going back. 

The stakes:
- If party members see their past selves, they can cause a madness.
