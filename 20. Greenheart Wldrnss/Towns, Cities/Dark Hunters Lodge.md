Regional Location: [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]
Subsection: lodge at edge of [[The Wildwoods]] and [[The Umbrawood]]

**QNS**
- this could be a lodge for people that hunt the abominations of [[The Umbrawood]] for sport
- It could feel like a large hunting cabin decorated with trophies of the downed creature that they hunt
- Not structured
	- could be led by a hunts-master, democratically elected based on skill
	- everyone votes once a year on the winter solstice ???
