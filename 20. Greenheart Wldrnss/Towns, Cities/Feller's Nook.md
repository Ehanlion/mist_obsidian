Regional Location: [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]
Subsection: A gathering of peoples in the heart of [[The Wildwoods]]

**QNS**
- This is a group of people who focus on providing exotic timber exports from [[The Wildwoods]]
- They are a primary supplier of wood to [[Hope Town]] 
- They hunt dangerous types of wood 
	- make sure to use wood types from *The Edge Chronicles*
	- Specifically Bloodoak + preserve its properties
	- Luftwood too
- They operate as a large, organized set of "families" each of which sends a delegate to "The Round Table of the Fellers" which is a rudimentary and basic form of government.
- However, this is a very loosey-goosey kind of organization and they merely cooperate to avoid conflict
- Each "Family" sells their own goods, has their own exports, and stores their own wares -> they guard their stores jealously
