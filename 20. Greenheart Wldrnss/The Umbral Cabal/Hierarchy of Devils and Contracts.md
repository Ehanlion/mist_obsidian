Subsection: [[The Umbral Cabal]]
# Hierarchy of Devils
[Reference to Hierarchy](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Devil#Hierarchy)

**Hierarchy:**
1. *Archdevil* - An Archdevil oversees all lower devils, there is only one in my world
2. *Dukes* - Directly serve the Archdevils, do not oversee other devils
3. *Pit Fiends* - the Pit Fiends head the greater devils
4. *Greater Devils* - The greater devils oversee all of the lesser and least devils
5. *Lesser Devils* - Subservient devils to Greater Devils
6. *Least Devils* - Tools of the Lesser Devils

The *Archdevil* of [[The Umbral Cabal]] would be its leader
Then his advisors and executors would be his *Dukes*, but they wouldn't oversee any devils. Treat them like hitmen 
*Pit Fiends* would be like the "managers" of the lowers
Then *Greater Devils*, *Lesser Devils*, and *Least Devils* would all fall in order beneath that
# General Roles
**General Roles**
- The Devils, in general, act as lawyers to other factions
- They serve to negotiate inner-faction deals
- Independently, they serve to hunt the Abyssal creatures of [[The Umbrawood]]
# How Contracts Work
[Contract terms webpage](https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/contract-terminology/)

 **Contract Basics**
 - Contracts are written in a mix of the signatory's primary language and infernal
 - Sneaky clauses are always written in infernal
 - A contract is binding to the creature that signs it
 - A creature can escape a contract in the following ways:
	 - completing a clause that releases the contracts
	 - negotiating out of a contract
- Killing the contract's creator DOES NOT release the signatory from their contract
	- As contracts are inherited, a high devil will always assume the contract
	- Only killing the archdevil will release a bound signatory from its contract

**Devil Inheritance**
- A contract is always inherited by a Devil higher in the hierarchy
- *Dukes* cannot inherit contracts, as they are bound to serve only the *Archdevil*
- The *Archdevil* is the final inheritor of all contracts
- When a Devil of any level inherits a contract, they have two immediate choices:
	1. *Uphold the contract* - The devil may choose to uphold the contract, binding the signatory by the same terms of the original contract to the new devil 
	2. *Break the contract* - The devil may choose to break the contract, releasing the signatory from the terms of the contract

**Types of Force Clauses**
- *Do it or else ...* - A contract stipulates that the signatory must resign to absolute obedience of the contracting devil or face consequences
- *By a certain time ...* -  A contract stipulates a hard date by which a certain set of consequences unfold 
- *If you fail ...* - A contract stipulates a required goal to be met, or there are consequences  

**Breaking a Contract**
- The usual default is that "your soul is forfeit"
- What that translates in game terms to is "your soul is no longer yours"
- This has to have a dangerous, deadly, life-changing consequence, otherwise people would break contracts left and right
- I think a transformation is always necessary
- I also think losing control of your character is a good addition, since the Infernal energy overcomes your soul's being
- Realistically, what happens is that your soul becomes devilish and your body is corrupted, turning from your current race into a:
	- lesser devil form
	- Abishai is another good one
	- Something humiliating
# The Archdevil (in context)
**Role** for [[The Umbral Cabal]]
- The *Archdevil* is the overseer of all [[The Umbral Cabal]]
- They are served by loyal *Dukes*, who act as executors on the *Archdevil's* wills
- The *Archdevil* makes deals with other factions to strengthen [[The Umbral Cabal]]
	- Deals with [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and [[Fedorov's Legion]]
	- Deals with [[Garrick Blackthorn]] and [[The Iron-fist Marauders]]
	- Deals with [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]]

**Killing the Archdevil**
- If the *Archdevil* is killed, the following transpires
- A refractory period of 24 hours will immediately ensure 
- The current *Archdevil* always has a keepsake that has no power until they die, then it becomes the *Infernal Source*
- First, all contracts controlled by the *Archdevil* are held in stasis until a new *Archdevil* is crowned
- Then, a contest will ensure. Whoever possesses the *Infernal Source* at the end of the 24 hours becomes the new *Archdevil*
- All those of devil-descent know the location of the *Infernal Source* during this time
- Any who is a devil-spawn may pickup the *Infernal Source*, any who is not of devil-spawn sustains grave injuries
- The creature who bears the *Infernal Sources* after 24 hours becomes the *Archdevil* and assumes all contracts immediately and transforms into an *Archdevil*
- Then the *Infernal Source* transforms into a form of their choosing

The big takeaways is that:
- killing an *Archdevil* releases all the contracts that it presides over until a new *Archdevil* is crowned
- You can become the *Archdevil* if you both possess the *Infernal Source* at the end of 24 hours and are of devil-descent
- Only contracts that the *Archdevil* directly owns can be overtaken in this way
