Regional Location: [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]
Subsection: Within [[The Starwoods]]
# At First Glance
*As you continue through the dense forests, forging small creeks and clambering over knotted roots of ancients trees, the air seems to clear. The forest seems calmer and more misty. The sounds of the birds chirping, and wolves baying in the distance seem to mellow as you stand amidst the swaying branches, golden light filtering down onto you. You notice a message written in Elvish, then orcish, then sylvan, draconic, Dwarvish, gnomish and so on and so forth. This message lays inscribed upon an ancient tree.

If approached, read the message on the tree: 
*Herein lies the domain of the Green Order, ordained protectors of the forests of stars. If you are not of our collective, halt, or face your fate as deemed by the lights above. As long as stars stand strong and our forests are bathed in lunarian motes of power, our borders will stand till tests of time.*

GM Note: Describe this tree and other, oddly larger ones that seem to make up what appears to be a crude barrier, stretching off into the forest. The space between these trees has small dancing, constellations of light, almost like miniature star clusters. If the party has not completed [[Quest to Enter the Green Order]], they will face the 'dire consequences' alluded to by the message (which means combat).
- Note that, while combat is inevitable, the Green Order are not murders and are always looking for more members or friendlies. If the party surrenders or stands down allow the combat to turn into a pitch to start the [[Quest to Enter the Green Order]].
# Notable NPCs
The Green order is mainly elves, but the real requirement is some proficiency with the forest (which means Druidic proficiencies). The following are major NPCs that are apart of the Green Order:
- [[Elder Thistleton]]: Elder of the Green Order.
- [[Sylvia Starlight]]: The first of the Green Order, all power of the Order derives from her sacrifice. She is said to be of divine inheritance. 
# Related Locations
The Green Order is located just to the East of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]], in regions of the [[The Starwoods]], East into the forest from [[King Gillian's Channel]]. It is apart of the larger region of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]].
# Related Missions
- [[Quest to Enter the Green Order]]: Needed to complete in order to be allowed deeper into the Green Order's territory. If not completed, maybe not the first combat, but a later encounter will seal the fate of the party if they are found trespassing. 
- [[Quest of Potions for the Green Order]]: Only completable after Entering the Green Order. Players go on deep expeditions into the [[The Starwoods]] and beyond in order to search for rare ingredients and harvestable things in order to create exotic potions for the Green Order. For which they will pay a pretty penny. Assigned by [[Pombo Wrinkle, the Short One]] if the players are accepted into the Green Order and express interest in potions. 
# Deeper Dive
This section needs to cover the types of people that populate the area, events (if any) that occur in this location, buildings or structures etc. that make up this location, and anything else. Basically, if a player asks about something, you should aim to have an answer here.
# Entering the Order
As an outsider, [[The Green Order]] accepts a select and bespoke arraignment of people to become a member of their exclusive order. The qualifications are listed below. Note that, for someone who does not yet qualify, I wrote a mission title: [[Quest to Enter the Green Order]] which covers a couple approaches that can be taken to qualify to enter [[The Green Order]] as honorary members.

1. *Birthright:* A person born in the Order to a parent of the order in good standing is deemed a ranking member. However, they are subject to the same rules as the Asylum-seekers detailed later. At age 18 they are evaluated, at if they do not meet standards, they are removed. 
2. *Prowess:* Demonstrating exceptional abilities in Ranger-skill and Druid-craft, a hero can join the ranks of the Order. This demonstrating involves a choice between spell utilization (using spells for utilitarian purposes) or single combat. 
3. *Asylum:* If someone, under the age of 18 is escaping from something horrid into the [[The Starwoods]] and thus into the domain of the Order, then they are granted Asylum. Once they turn 18, they are evaluated and if they meets the high standards of the Order then they can stay. Otherwise, they are removed from the order and left at the western border of [[The Starwoods]]. 
## Removal
The order has strict tenants to remain a ranking member:

1. Respect the good of the forest creatures and the forest beings, do not desecrate that which is deemed holy and pure.
2. Maintain spiritual purity and forsake the following of the
