Regional Location: [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]
Subsection: Just outside the reaches of [[The Starwoods]], fully within [[The Wildwoods]].

# True Nature: (Don't show Players)
The Lake of Constellations was not always a lake, in fact it was a quarry for [[The Many]]. It was one of several on Mist, but the only one in [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]. [[The Many]] dug it to mine for [[Stormphrax]] which is why surrounding the lake are 3 [[Archaic Storm Conduits]], used to channel lightning into the ground allow [[The Many]] to mine it. Now lost to time, the quarry has filled, the abundant rainfall of [[The Wildwoods]] quickly turning it into a freshwater lake. 

# Description:
This massive lake is quiet and dark, at night the brilliant lights of the cosmos above reflect perfectly onto the dark waters.
