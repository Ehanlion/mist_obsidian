# Feelers:
	The sounds of the forest are shocking. It sounds like a city but there are no buildings, just trees. Chattering monkeys call eachother in the distances, birds chirp overhead, prowling dogs growl in the distance -- it is so very, alive. The trees are every shade of green. The ground is densely covered with creepers, bushes, and flowery growths. You can smell the sweetness in the air -- like honey. The ground crawls upwards and downwards, it is covered in large boulders, and the forest stretches out ahead of you.

What the woods **smell** like:
1. The intoxicating fragrance of the fantastical flowers, a blend of sweet and spicy aromas that fills the air with a sense of wonder.
2. The fresh, earthy scent of the forest floor, rich with the aroma of moss, ferns, and the damp earth.
3. The subtle, comforting smell of wood and leaves, mingled with a hint of something ancient and mystical.
4. The clean, crisp air after a rain, when every scent seems amplified, fresh and rejuvenating.
5. As night falls, a faint scent of night-blooming flowers, adding a layer of mystery and allure to the forest air.

What the woods **sound** like:
1. Owlbears hoot in the distance.
2. Birds caw at you from overhead.
3. Wolves growl as they hunt in the distance.
4. The leaves whoosh and scratch as the wind tosses the uppermost branches around.

What the woods **look** like:
1. The trees are massive and thick; their branches wide and grand.
2. The leaves come in every size imaginable -- and every texture.
3. Every shade of green you could imagine greets your eyes.
4. The iridescent glow of the tree bark, shifting in hues of blues and greens, reminiscent of the ocean meeting the sky.
5. Fireflies, like tiny, floating lanterns, illuminating the darkness with their enchanting golden light.
6. The vibrant colors of the leaves, ranging from deep purples to bright oranges, forming a vivid canopy overhead.
7. The occasional glimpse of ethereal wildlife, such as glowing deer or shadowy, elusive creatures darting through the underbrush.
