These lush groves are a haven amidst the tumultuous forests of [[The Wildwoods]] and the fearsome borders of [[The Umbrawood]]. While all of the forests amidst [[The Greenheart Wilderness]] are dense with growing plants, the verdant groves are island-renowned for just how well rare plants grow amidst the trees. Rare creatures find sanctuary here alongside the rare plants.
