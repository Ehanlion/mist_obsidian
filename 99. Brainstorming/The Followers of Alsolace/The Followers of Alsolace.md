# The followers of Alsolace:
Groups come to villages as travelling ministers of the good god Alsolace. They do not preach desperately for those in the village to join their order. They do not force anyone to join in the hands of Alsolace, the golden light. No, they preach that Alsolace is a loving and accepting god; Alsolace accepts anyone for any of their beliefs and for any of their beliefs in another God.
