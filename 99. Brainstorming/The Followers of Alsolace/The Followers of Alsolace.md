Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: A growing cult spreading across towns. Started in [[Schooner's End]] and is beginning to spread up the coast.
# The followers of Alsolace:
Groups come to villages as travelling ministers of the good god [[Alsolace]]. They do not preach desperately for those in the village to join their order. They do not force anyone to join in the hands of [[Alsolace]], the golden light. No, they preach that [[Alsolace]] is a loving and accepting god; [[Alsolace]] accepts anyone for any of their beliefs and for any of their beliefs in another God. 
# Their True Nature:
The followers of [[Alsolace]] are a power-hungry cult. Their motives are well concealed in and amidst cunning misdirection and powerful speeches meant to enthrall the people listening to the followers. The follower's goal, empowered by their leader [[Tennyson Heralds]], is to convert all members of villages to the following of [[Alsolace]] and then rob them blind of all their gold that they give as tribute to shrines to [[Alsolace]].
# Shrines to Alsolace:
When members of the followers come to a village, they will eventually want to establish a shine to [[Alsolace]] somewhere in the village. Offering can be left to the shrine in the form of gold, since it is from volumes of gold that [[Alsolace]] draws his strength.
