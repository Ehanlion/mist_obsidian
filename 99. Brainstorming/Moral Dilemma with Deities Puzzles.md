# Description of the Trolley Problem from Wiki:
> To make the parallel as close as possible, it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram, which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots, the mob have five hostages, so that in both examples, the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five.

# Using it as a Puzzle:
I think it would be super cool for a stage of a puzzle to involve having to choose between saving the one man, or saving the 5 depending on what a specific god would do. So it would take place using minecarts and a greater image of the one person and 5 persons struggling on the tracks. To move on the players would have to pull a level to push the minecart down the track to press a button across the room. The players would be isolated from the room in sort of a viewing platform: able to see the room and contents but not interact. Getting the minecart to press the button would open a door in the room that they are in. 

**IMPORTANT: Reskinning the people on the tracks:**
To make this work you need to *change how the people appear* on the tracks to suit the dilemma for a specific deity. Maybe make them stronger, weaker, change their race, etc. 

**IMPORTANT: Setting the scene in each room:**
Make sure to describe damage to each room as they walk in. Make it clear that its some form of damage from a creature. High searching check reveals maybe a type of enemy or the genre of creature. Try to make it clear, especially after the first room that they will have to fight something if they fail to do the puzzle correctly. 

Make it VERY clear that they either get the puzzle correct and then the door opens in the room to move on OR they get it wrong, fight something and kill it, then the door opens same as the other way and they can move on. Either or, but these fights should be VERY deadly to encourage getting the puzzles correct. 
# [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]] to use:
1. [[The Strife Emperor]]:
	1. Commandment at play: "To kill is life's greatest pleasure, and perfecting the art of slaughter is life's greatest pursuit."
	2. Changes made: None, run dilemma as it.
	3. *Solution:* Kill the 5 on one track.
	4. *Reason:* Commandment shows emperor believes in killing in masses and to slaughter is to embrace the pleasure of life. 
	5. *Failing the puzzle:* Some form of demon brute creature
2. [[The Spider Queen]]:
	1. Commandment as play: "Death to the elves who live under the sun, and death to all their allies!"
	2. Changes made: Reskin the solo person as an elf and reskin the others as dragonborn (or a race that has no allyship with the elves).
	3. *Solution:* Kill the one on one track.
	4. *Reason:* Commandment shows that the queen hates the elves, and given the chance to kill one elf or 5 of an irrelevant race, she will take the elf every time. 
	5. *Failing the puzzle:* Some form of horrible arachnid monster
3. [[The Ruiner]]:
	1. Commandment: "The weak exist to be killed by the strong. Be the strong."
	2. Changes: The 5 on one track are show to be malnourished and weak whilst the one person on the other track is adorned in armor and strong. 
	3. *Solution:* Kill the 5 on one track.
	4. *Reason:* Commandment shows that Ruiner values the strong over the weak, be the strong and vanquish the weaklings on the track. You are the strong since you control their fates. 
	5. *Failing the puzzle:* IDK on this one yet
# Forcing them to see how the puzzle works first:
- Start the first room with [[The Knowing Mentor]].
- Don't make any changes to the puzzle
- *Solution:* The first answer the party gives is always wrong.
- *Failing the puzzle:* Causes a fight with some creature (Idk yet but make it related to the god for sure). This fight is not deadly, make the creature relatively tame and non-combative, but make it clear that they have to kill it to move on.
