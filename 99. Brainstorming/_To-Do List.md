# Running to-do list:
Add tasks as they come up. Do not pre-create this list, but rather update it as you create the world as a way to remind yourself of ideas:
- [x] Work on smears burrow to flesh it out for the next campaign session.
- [ ] Continue updating all features, towns, cities, and NPCs to the new 'regional location' and 'subsection' indexing.
- [ ] Fix the readme to avoid mentioning people 'finding Mist,' since this is rather impossible with the Aether-veil projector still functioning.
