# Running to-do list:
Add tasks as they come up. Do not pre-create this list, but rather update it as you create the world as a way to remind yourself of ideas:
- [ ] Work on smears burrow to flesh it out for the next campaign session.
- [ ] Continue updating all features, towns, cities, and NPCs to the new 'regional location' and 'subsection' indexing.
