# Running to-do list:
Add tasks as they come up. Do not pre-create this list, but rather update it as you create the world as a way to remind yourself of ideas:
- [x] Work on smears burrow to flesh it out for the next campaign session.
- [ ] Continue updating all features, towns, cities, and NPCs to the new 'regional location' and 'subsection' indexing.
- [x] Fix the readme to avoid mentioning people 'finding Mist,' since this is rather impossible with the Aether-veil projector still functioning. 
- [ ] finish all towns in the north west
- [x] add some new features to the inlands of the north west 
- [ ] work more on the sea caves in the north west
- [x] add some new towns to south east coast
- [x] add some new features to the south east coast
- [ ] add rulings from critical role setting to the free action rulings
- [ ] Come up with side quests in the north west highlands
