# Description:
A Naga guards the passage way. If you try to walk by you are threatened with an attack. You must rhyme with the Naga to pass; a rhyme suitable of impressing the Naga is required (this part should be persuasion, flat, disadvantage, or advantage depending on the rhyme).

They can also ask the Naga questions, in rhyme of course, and she will answer back in rhyme.
