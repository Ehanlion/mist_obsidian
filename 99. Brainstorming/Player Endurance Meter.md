# Description:
This is an idea for a meter to track a players fatigue from an intensive environment. Not all combat scenarios are equal: sometimes you fight on the cold slops of a mountain in a blizzard, maybe on the fiery slopes of a volcano, maybe underwater. In intensive situations, I feed like D&D is not super well equipped to handle the intensity of some of these scenarios. 

The player endurance meter is my idea for a new tracker for these intense situations. It will track strain from an environment against a player's maximum for that type of strain. If a player exceeds their maximum, they incur consequences. 

# Mechanics:
Endurance is tracked in strain points. A player gains strain points when subjected to an intense environment. A player has a maximum strain which is a maximum number of strain points that they can endure. Exceeding the maximum incurs a penalty.

Based on the situation the ability score added to the maximum strain may be different. In general it will be: 
1. **1 + Ability Modifier** if no special adaption to environment
2. **1 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency** if special adaption to environment
