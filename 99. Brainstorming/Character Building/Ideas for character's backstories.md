# Dead/Missing Parents
Instead of having a backstory where you lost your parents and are an adventurer in their name, you can dodge the cliche with some of these options:
1. Parents are locked away in a prison with an unknown location.
2. Parents left to protect you from something that was chasing them.

# Exiled
This is the trope of "I've done something bad so now I must leave my home forever" kind of cliche. It can be dull.
1. Maybe instead you are next in line for a throne you do not desire and leave by faking your own death and taking a new name.
2. Maybe you are a war refugee who cannot go home because of the crimes they did to an unjust government. They can go home if that corrupt government is overthrown. 

# Vengance
Someone did something bad and now I have to get payback kind of backstory. Could fall short or could leave you wanting if the task is done too quickly.
1. A twist could be finding a slow, but alternative path to forgiveness. 
2. Maybe also the path could be a journey through the 5 stages of grief.

# The Lone Wolf
An occurrence in many backstories is the idea that a character separates themselves from the rest of the world. It can be difficult to form meaningful bonds with party members if you've lived your life as a single traveler.
1. Be the one seeking a team or squad instead.
2. Be the founder of your next group because you've always wanted to have one despite your loneliness.

# Moody
What to challenge the norm. Choose to be upbeat instead of sour and dour. Choose happy go lucky over downcast and down trodden. 
1. Maybe you are learning new things and that is the root of your drive for adventure.
2. Maybe you are an adventurer on holiday and get mixed up in some crazy story.
