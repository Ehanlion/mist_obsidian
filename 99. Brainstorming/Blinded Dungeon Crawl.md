# Description:
A dungeon where the players are magically blinded, overpowering all forms of sight, both for enemies and for players. Players should need to draw a variant of the map as they explore as there will be quest objectives that they need to remember the location of. Move directions should be only on compass directions and given only in terms of compass directions so N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW only.

> Ahead of you is a large stone door with a key hole in the middle of it. The door is set into an arch where lettering is inscribed around the arch. It reads (**In Deep Speech**): 
> 
> In the depths of a dungeon, both ghastly and old, 
> Lies a curse of the dark, so bitter and bold. 
> Blinding eyes, sealing ears, in shadows it creeps, 
> In its labyrinthine heart, the silence it keeps.
> 
> Here, keys are the treasure, in recesses so deep, 
> Where the echoes of footsteps in the darkness leap. 
> Through the corridors winding, the seekers must tread, 
> With only their courage, where many have fled.
>
> Monsters lurk in the shadows, with whispers and stares, 
> In the gloom of the dungeon, they're caught unawares. 
> Eyes unseeing, ears unhearing, in this nightmarish game, 
> Each step is a gamble, with fortune or fame.
>
> In the darkest of depths, where the lost keys hide, 
> The brave face their fears, with no light as their guide. 
> With each key that's uncovered, a hope starts to rise, 
> To escape with the prize, under unforgiving skies.
>
> But beware, oh brave souls, for the dungeon's cruel jest,
> In its blindness and deafness, it puts you to test. 
> For the monsters that hunt you, are more than mere fright, 
> They're the fears within you, in the absence of light.
>
> So venture with valor, in this realm of despair, 
> Where the keys are your lifeline, in the thick, stifling air. 
> In the dungeon of darkness, where silence is king, 
> Your courage is the light, making freedom's bell ring.

# AI Art of the Blinded Dungeon:

# What to tell players:
1. Tell them that they are **blind from magic darkness and deaf.** Both effects are magical and supersede any effects overcoming either conditions. 
2. Tell players that they should keep drawings on paper of the dungeon. There is no chance they beat this if they don't. However, players **cannot share their maps with each other.** 
# Running this: 
1. **Force Party Move:** As players enter, make sure they start in close, but different rooms.
2. Have players roll initiative.
3. Players can take an action, bonus action, and movement on their turn.
4. Enemies move between players initiative counts. 

Since we are in initiative, if a player encounters an enemy, they can fight like normal since they are already in initiative. This makes it like a weird, combat/exploration dungeon without vision. 
# Fundamental Rooms:
1. **One way passages:** some hall ways only allow someone to walk in one direction at a time.
2. **Hall way length:** passaged between rooms should be precisely equal to the walking speed of the slowest player minus 5 feet, allowing any player to get from the middle of one room to the middle of the next room. 
3. **Dexterity check room:** to get from one room to another, a player must walk on a very thin walkway requiring an acrobatics check. If they fail, they are teleported to a random room.
4. **Teleport room:** Walking through a passage way teleports you to a new room.
5. **Elemental Keyed Doors:** Some doors to move further are keyed behind and element, meaning the door has to be hit with something that deals a corresponding damage type to it. Arcana checks to read runes on the doors can identify the type of element required. 
# Icon Rooms:
For this dungeon to work, there need to be icon rooms that can be used as landmarks to players. Maybe something to interact with, a statue, or something along those lines. Essentially for every one icon room in the dungeon, there are 4 blank rooms. These icon rooms should be sparse. 
1. **Statue of the Blind Man:** There is a statue of a man with his eyes closed. He holds a mirror turned away from himself facing the room. It links to the mirror held by the statue of the blind woman.
2. **Statue of the Blind Woman:** These is a statue of a woman with her eyes closed. She holds a mirror turned away from herself facing the room. It links to the mirror held by the statue of the blind man.
3. **Glimmering Pool:** There is a glowing shimmering pool. It does nothing, but maybe people *think* it does. 
4. **Library/Map Room:** This room has a map of a small, 3x3 section of rooms. A room lights up with an indicator if there is a person in the room but does not show what or who the creature is. There are also stone bookcases with many many books. Most of them are blank. 
# Enemies in the Blind Dungeon:
Enemies walk the dungeon as well, taking their turns between the players initiative counts. 
# Magic Suppression:
The dungeon is very interesting in that it blocks any magical attempt to beat its puzzles, being the creation of a powerful arch-mage, this makes sense. However it **does not block** spells that deal damage and attack since parts of the dungeon will **require** elemental damage, only dealt by spells, to be used.
