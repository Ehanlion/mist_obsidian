Category: [[_To-Do List]]
# Description:
A dungeon where the players are magically blinded, overpowering all forms of sight, both for enemies and for players. Players should need to draw a variant of the map as they explore as there will be quest objectives that they need to remember the location of. Move directions should be only on compass directions and given only in terms of compass directions so N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW only.
# Running this: 
1. Have players roll initiative.
2. Players can take an action, bonus action, and movement on their turn.
3. Enemies move between players initiative counts. 

Since we are in initiative, if a player encounters an enemy, they can fight like normal since they are already in initiative. This makes it like a weird, combat/exploration dungeon without vision. 
# Fundamental Rooms:
1. **One way passages:** some hall ways only allow someone to walk in one direction at a time.
2. **Hall way length:** passaged between rooms should be precisely equal to the walking speed of the slowest player minus 5 feet, allowing any player to get from the middle of one room to the middle of the next room. 
3. **Dexterity check room:** to get from one room to another, a player must walk on a very thin walkway requiring an acrobatics check. If they fail, they are teleported to a random room.
4. **Teleport room:** Walking through a passage way teleports you to a new room.
# Icon Rooms:
For this dungeon to work, there need to be icon rooms that can be used as landmarks to players. Maybe something to interact with, a statue, or something along those lines. Essentially for every one icon room in the dungeon, there are 4 blank rooms. These icon rooms should be sparse. 
1. **Statue of the Blind Man:** There is a statue of a man with his eyes closed. He holds a mirror turned away from himself facing the room. It links to the mirror held by the statue of the blind woman.
2. **Statue of the Blind Woman:** These is a statue of a woman with her eyes closed. She holds a mirror turned away from herself facing the room. It links to the mirror held by the statue of the blind man.
3. **Glimmering Pool:** There is a glowing shimmering pool. It does nothing, but maybe people *think* it does. 
# Enemies in the Blind Dungeon:
Enemies walk the dungeon as well, taking their turns between the players initiative counts.
