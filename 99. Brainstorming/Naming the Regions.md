> [!NOTE] Naming the Regions
> I realized that, despite all the work I have put into Mist to date, nothing really has an "official" name. It is just a collection of Direction-based names. Thus, it is my goal to establish memorable names for each region and re-name each region. 
# Original Names:
**Breaking down the regions:** I built the world to be split easily into quadrant regions ... 
- Upper Right: -> North-east -> *The North-East Forests* -> **Forest**
- Lower Right: -> South-east -> *The South-East Mountains* + *The South-East Coast* -> **Mountains** + **Coast / Plains**
- Lower Left: -> South-west -> *The South-West Arid Expanse* -> **Desert / Coast**
- Upper Left:  -> North-west -> *The North-West Highlands* -> **Coast / Cliff / Plains**
- Central 1: -> Northern -> *The Discordant Plains* -> **Open Desolate Plains**
- Central 2: -> Southern -> *Unnamed Gorge?* -> **Chasm**

The Central locations are located in the middle area of the map
So this is all I have name-wise for the campaign as of 9/26/2024 ... 
# Name Ideas by Region
## The North-East Forests
**Geography:** Heavily forested

- Verdantia

- Arborvale
- Leafshade Expanse

**Greenreach** is a winner to me

### The Deep Woods
- The Heartwood Forest
- Elderbough
- The Verdant Depths
- Whispering Wilds
- Emerald Canopy

Okay I love **The Heartwood Forest** as another forest for the overall region
and **The Elderbough** as just the name of some special tree or something

**The Wildwoods** 
### The Twilight Woods
- Duskmire Grove

- Half-Light Woodlands

**The Starwoods** is kind of cool
### The Dark Woods
- Nightfall Thicket
- Umbrawood
- Blackthorn Forest

**The Umbrawood**

Also **The Gloomgrove** would be a cool name for a part of this

The mountains divide at the central gorge
