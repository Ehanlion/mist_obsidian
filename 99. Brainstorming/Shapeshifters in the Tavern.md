Subcategory: Tavern in [[Smears-burrow]], 2 bartenders
# Description:
Two bartenders were removed from duty (not sure how) and replaced with two shapeshifters (not sure what creature yet). Their goal is to gather information and report back to [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]]. 

They are proficient poisoners and have been keeping the two bartenders drugged and incapacitated for some weeks now, only feeding them scraps of food to keep them alive (this would indicate humanity and empathy and some intelligence with the shapeshifting creatures). 
# Solving the Mystery:
I think the only way this mystery gets solved is by players analyzing how the behavior of the two bartenders has changed in the past time period. Maybe the shapeshifters are doing actions and mannerisms that the original bartenders would never do.
