Rules index: [[D&D Optional Mechanics]]
Originally from Chris and his campaign; I am borrowing these rules for this campaign.
# Death Saves
Make death save at start of turn
At 1 success you can crawl half walking speed while prone
At 2 success you can use a bonus action that is anything but casting a spell
At 3 success you return at one hit point and can only use movement, bonus action, or action on that turn.

When a character goes [[unconscious]] from being below 1 hit point, they suffer a point of [[exhaustion]]. 
Implicitly, anything that returns a character to [[stable]] also brings them to 1 hit point and they can only use a movement, bonus action, or action on their next turn.
