**King of Stone**
Hail to the king under the mountain,
Hail to the one born of stone,
Hail to the brother, lost long to time,
Hail to the one left alone.

**Shanty of the Sea Mistress**
Let prayers sing to the wild winds they do fly,
As fears they mount, near up to the sky.
Let kin and kind fall back in line,
And turn our backs on the old and divine. 
For the sea, she is the mistress of terror,
Her gales and waves too tall, now beware her,
Let her fight us all of long day and night,
Till 'morrow' beckons, we sail ready to fight. 

**In a town on the Coast**
In a town on the coast,
She sings and she boasts,
She pours the drink for all men.

She'll dance and she'll sway,
Till the next break of day,
But her voice, she sings like a siren.

She smiles and she waves,
We best go on our way,
Never to forget her round face.

And when blade comes to heart,
And blood seeps to stone,
I'll pray to be back on the coast.
