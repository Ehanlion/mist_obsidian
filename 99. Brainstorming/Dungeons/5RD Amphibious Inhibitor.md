Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: [[The Sunken Caverns]]

**Description** 
In the [[The Sunken Caverns]], there exists an ancient structure of [[The Many]] hidden deep within the bowels of the watery depths. It was once deactivated, but has since been reactivated by [[The Aquan Nations]]. As one swims in the passages within [[The Sunken Caverns]], they notice it is very easy to swim, your body feels lighter, the waters glow a warm color, and your vision is not limited by your darkvision as the waters are visible and as bright as the sky above. Inside this variant of [[The 5 Room Dungeon]], there exists guards, some ancient lore about [[The Many]], and a magical inhibitor guarded by a powerful, activated golem. 

**Mechanics**
The Inhibitor causes the following effects in [[The Sunken Caverns]]:
1. *Easy to see water*: water is visible out to double the normal range and glows faintly. No area in the waters is considered to be anything less than dim light.
2. *Freedom of Motion*: the waters are easy to swim in, any creature has a swimming speed equal to half their walking speed in here by default. 
3. *Aquan Empowerment*: while active, the magic of the inhibitor has been twisted and now grants augmented powers to the casters of [[The Aquan Nations]] that are here. These creatures gain additional water themed spells (to be decided at a later date) that they can cast 1/day for each spell.

4. *Entrance*:
	1. The entrance way is bubbly and hard to swim through, as the bubble drive you upwards against your swimming strokes. From the stone beneath you, massive groves of bleached looking sea kelp and schools of pale fish can be seen. Through the ripples of bubbles, you can see old stone columns and the dark stone of an ancient looking monument, recent destroyed. 
	2. The areas encompassed by bubble columns are considered difficult terrain when swimming down through but are considered "forgiving terrain" when swimming up through them, meaning every 5 feet of movement actually moves you 10 feet.
	3. In hidden alcoves, a small warband of [[The Aquan Nations]] troops stands guard waiting for intruders. Each has a pet shark as per the Sahuaguin aquatic telepathy trait. A Mind Rock Crab stands guard with them as an envoy of [[Karak-Ulgurath]]. 
	4. This combat should feel very vertical. Bubble columns add difficult movement and terrain. Fields of kelp offer cover and hiding places. Fish swarms attack anyone hurt the past round as a lair action (initiative count 20). Columns of stone here can be tipped over (DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, 4d10 bludgeoning damage). 
	5. After combat, they might choose to investigate what is being guarded. This area is the entrance to a dungeon. It was unlocked by [[Silvan Gile]], an Archwizard for [[Fedorov's Legion]] as a way to empower the heart of [[The Aquan Nations]] that are here and to aid in the main quest that they are undertaking: excavating powerful structures (of [[The Many]]) to find a [[Shard]] for [[Fedorov's Legion]]. 
	6. With a DC 15 Investigation/Arcana check, there are clear signs of powerful magic being used to blast apart this area.
	7. With a DC 13 History check, it is clear that this area was once some for of building from long ago, but was recently destroyed.
