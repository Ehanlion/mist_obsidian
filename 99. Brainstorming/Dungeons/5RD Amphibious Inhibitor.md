Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: [[The Sunken Caverns]]

**Description** 
In the [[The Sunken Caverns]], there exists an ancient structure of [[The Many]] hidden deep within the bowels of the watery depths. It was once deactivated, but has since been reactivated by [[The Aquan Nations]]. As one swims in the passages within [[The Sunken Caverns]], they notice it is very easy to swim, your body feels lighter, the waters glow a warm color, and your vision is not limited by your darkvision as the waters are visible and as bright as the sky above. Inside this variant of [[The 5 Room Dungeon]], there exists guards, some ancient lore about [[The Many]], and a magical inhibitor guarded by a powerful, activated golem. 

**Mechanics**
The Inhibitor causes the following effects in [[The Sunken Caverns]]:
1. *Easy to see water*: water is visible out to double the normal range and glows faintly. No area in the waters is considered to be anything less than dim light.
2. *Freedom of Motion*: the waters are easy to swim in, any creature has a swimming speed equal to half their walking speed in here by default. 
3. *Aquan Empowerment*: while active, the magic of the inhibitor has been twisted and now grants augmented powers to the casters of [[The Aquan Nations]] that are here. These creatures gain additional water themed spells (to be decided at a later date) that they can cast 1/day for each spell. 

**Breakdown,** [[The 5 Room Dungeon]]
4. *Entrance*:
	1. The entrance way is bubbly and hard to swim through, as the bubble drive you upwards against your swimming strokes. From the stone beneath you, massive groves of bleached looking sea kelp and schools of pale fish can be seen. Through the ripples of bubbles, you can see old stone columns and the dark stone of an ancient looking monument, recent destroyed. 
	2. The areas encompassed by bubble columns are considered difficult terrain when swimming down through but are considered "forgiving terrain" when swimming up through them, meaning every 5 feet of movement actually moves you 10 feet.
	3. In hidden alcoves, a small warband of [[The Aquan Nations]] troops stands guard waiting for intruders. Each has a pet shark as per the Sahuaguin aquatic telepathy trait. A Mind Rock Crab stands guard with them as an envoy of [[Karak-Ulgurath]]. 
	4. This combat should feel very vertical. Bubble columns add difficult movement and terrain. Fields of kelp offer cover and hiding places. Fish swarms attack anyone hurt the past round as a lair action (initiative count 20). Columns of stone here can be tipped over (DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, 4d10 bludgeoning damage). 
	5. After combat, they might choose to investigate what is being guarded. This area is the entrance to a dungeon. It was unlocked by [[Silvan Gile]], an Archwizard for [[Fedorov's Legion]] as a way to empower the heart of [[The Aquan Nations]] that are here and to aid in the main quest that they are undertaking: excavating powerful structures (of [[The Many]]) to find a [[Shard]] for [[Fedorov's Legion]]. 
	6. With a DC 15 Investigation/Arcana check, there are clear signs of powerful magic being used to blast apart this area.
	7. With a DC 13 History check, it is clear that this area was once some for of building from long ago, but was recently destroyed. 
5. *Puzzle*:
	1. The entrance puzzle for this is easy -- it does not have to be solved already, at least not by [[The Aquan Nations]]. It can still be locked since the "entrance" is just the troops of [[The Aquan Nations]] protecting the entrance because [[Fedorov's Legion]] (and by direct orders of [[Silvan Gile]]) ordered them to do it. 
	2. This entrance is a barrier and is impossible to open without completing the puzzle. The inside of the dungeon is not filled with water and the outside is, opening the door leads to a torrent rushing in. 
	3. I think we can use the [[Contaminated Hamiltonian Puzzle]] maybe? We could set this up with a double puzzle, a simple entrance puzzle followed by a more complex puzzle that leads to the device. The second puzzle should be a physical threat. The first puzzle should be a solve it and go kind of puzzle. 
	4. I want the second puzzle to intentionally split the group. Two per one puzzle, two per the other. Then when they escape the puzzles, they end up in two rooms separated by a thick wall of see-through crystal. Two in one room, two in the other. Then we end up in the setback and the battle there. 
	5. There are 4 keys in the battle, two blue and two red. The door on one room is red, and that room has the blue keys. The other door in one room is blue, and that room has the red keys. The keys can be inserted into a metal panel next to the large doors. Inserting both and turning them opens the other rooms door. Both doors open into another passage way. Traversing this passage way leads to the climax room with the inhibitor and golem. Opening a door hear must not lead to the final room, there must be another, non-locked door cutting off the path and the exits of both rooms must lead to each other first. 
6. *Setback*
	1. The setback should be a simple challenge that is a precursor to the main battle. The main battle will have a construct golem created to protect the newly activated Inhibitor. The precursor needs to allude to this.
	2. The Golem should be wildly too powerful for the group. It should have vast AC and Hitpoints and deal MASSIVE burst damage. The goal should be to, if the party does not find the secret, to obliterate at least one member instantly and then encourage them to retreat. 
	3. In this room we should have remains of attempted golem creations, form these small rock golems, weak but in large quantities should appear slowly, over the course of multiple rounds of combat. Have each exhibit SOME of the real golems strengths and some of its weakness.
	4. In this room, in this fight, there will be clear signs of math work and rune work done on the walls in scribing and chalk doing math and calculations, not only to enable the inhibitor, but to craft and create a powerful golem guardian to protect it. There is clear indication here that this inhibitor was SOMETHING ancient and was once a defense mechanism or a mechanism designed to augment life and make it easier, but that it has been transmuted into a inhibitor for the negative effects of the waters of [[The Sunken Caverns]]
7. *Climax*
	1. Inside the final room, there are two main things: a powerful golem, conjured by an Archmage [[Silvan Gile]], and the inhibitor, which is fully activated. 
	2. This room is dry and airtight, apart from the entrance. There are conduits on the ceiling that channel the inhibitor's power. 
	3. The Inhibitor: A tall, blue crystal monolith in the center of the room. A channel into the ground rings it. There are three "islands" spaced at 120 degree intervals around it. Each has a pedestal and a floating, spinning orb on top of it. It looks like those orbs could rest perfectly atop each pedestal, but they levitate now. One is Red, one is Purple, one is Blue. Each is 5 ft in diameter. The monolith shimmers a mix of all three colors and large, pulsing runes glow a faint sea-green upon its form. 
	4. The Golem: A huge Stone Golem with thick iron bands and a gargantuan metal sword. It has powerful enchantments on its body. In one hand is a gruesome looking claw with some prototype-looking attachment. It looks to be swirling with magic. A DC 20 Arcana check reveals an enchantment in some way similar to Counterspell. The Sword is huge, far too large to wield by any normal creature. The golem needs to have a VERY clear weakness, but not one the group can just stumble upon blindly. There should be three secrets, findable through the dungeon: one that can reduce the damage of its magical attacks, one that can reduce its AC, and one that removes some of its resistances. 
		1. Force Damage: Blasts apart its stone form creating cracks in armor, reducing the AC
		2. Acid Damage: reduces damage of magical attacks as sword corrodes, 
		3. Cold Damage: freezes over some of the runes, will inhibit its resistances and immunities
		4. Lightning Damage: empowers the golem, increases its movement speed and damage
		5. The Golem is immune to Force, Fire, Acid, Psychic, Poison damage, but not cold. Cold blocks enchantments that grant all of these
		6. *Maybe there is a way to factor in flooding this dungeon*. Maybe flooding water in can give some benefit to the fight??
8. *Resolution*
	1. The Inhibitor deactivates and the buffs granted to [[The Aquan Nations]] disappear
	2. The depth tolerability in the water goes away
	3. The vision in the water goes away
	4. The warmth of the water goes away
	5. The faint glowing of the water goes away.
