# Description
*A cold, vice grip squeezes your longs. The vibrancy in your vision fades, the beautiful hues of the worlds re-toned to a grayscale. The tips of your fingers feel numb and the sides of your temple feel taught. You limbs feel disconnected and distant as you swing you arms to move. You stomach churns with uneasiness.*

# Mechanical Effects
This is the list of effect that this curse incurs. Note that it is more powerful, so refer to the later section of 'Magically Removing the Curse' to see how, and if, it is possible to remove the curse.
-  This curse has a Charisma save of DC 14. The save can be repeated at the end of a long rest but not while the creature is near the source of the curse.
	-  e.g. if a creature gives you this curse for being in its dominion, and you try to rest in an area it control, you will find breaking the curse difficult. 
	-  Note, repeating the save is a choice. Every time you repeat the save and fail, you **constitution score decreases by 1**. (the score resets if the curse is lifted).
-  While under the effects of the Whisperer's Curse, you cannot regain hitpoints through magical means. This includes healing magic and magical healing potions.
-  If you fall [[unconscious]] while under this curse, make [[death saving throw]]s as normal. No healing magic can return you to life, but succeeding on your death saves will stabilize you. Additionally, a medicine check *can* stabilize you as it is non-magical. Natural hit point regeneration occurs after 1 hours, where it counts as a 'short rest' for the creature. See healing section for info.
-  Healing from resting while under the curse:
	-  A creature taking a [[short rest]] may expend up to it constitution modifier's worth of hit die. (minimum 1 hit die). 
	-  A creature taking a [[long rest]] may expend up to half its hit die, rounded down, to regain hit points. It regains a number of hit die equal to it constitution modifier *(if the modifier drops to be zero or lower, the creature stops regaining hit die from longs rests)*. 
	-  Any resources replenish from a short/long rest replenish as normal outside of hitpoints. 

**Magically Removing the Curse**:
Normally, greater restoration could easily purge this curse from a creatures soul. In this case that is not true. Since this curse stems from a powerful undead creature who directly, or indirectly bestowed it upon the cursed creature, it is harder to break. *Casting greater restoration will cause you to roll against the SOURCE's save DC. On a failure, the material components of the spell are NOT expended, but the slot is.*
