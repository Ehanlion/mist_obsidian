(Pronounced Bell-Mar)
Small shipping village along the coast of [[The South-East Arid Expanse]]. It is the village where [[Master Smith Claudia]] crafts and sells her wares and where [[Slug Stoll]] hails from. 

It is a small-ish town. Still large enough to support a large garrison as well as multiple ships that call its harbors home.
