Regional Location: [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]
Subsection: Primary tribe of [[The Bogbeast Swamps]]

**TODO**
- This is the tribe of [[Kiro Rikshaha]]
- They are deeply spiritual, lead by [[Kiro Rikshaha]]'s father, the tribe-master
- Their patron is The Woman of the Woods
	- This is a member of [[The Many]] who died fighting in the forest
	- The center of her influence is a [[Shard]]
- Their old patron was a more fearsome Ancient Green Dragon
	- Maybe name her Vizeeran the Green Death or something
	- she inhabits and ancient city in [[The Wildwoods]]
	- The area around her in very much a jungle that surrounds the city
	- The city could be an ancient spiritual site
	- This could be related to the divinities and their sealing away, presence of [[The Many]], monuments relating to [[The Divine Barrier]] and [[The Mist Codex]] and their creation could be here. The dragon could be safeguarding it or something? 
	- Maybe even Vizeeran controls the [[Shard]] of the member of [[The Many]] who fell and, while the shard has a visage of the member as the "patron," it is influenced and obfuscated by Vizeeran who has done magic to manipulate it. In reality, maybe Vizeeran could be the woman of the woods! 
- [[The Bog Tribe]] has a ritual
	- they have seekers and hunters
	- Both have a similar ritual
	- To become one, after training, they must complete a quest
	- They spit a huge compass with tons of points on it like a spin the wheel kind of thing, one will standout and that will be the quest. 
	- Make sure one of them is to Kill Vizeeran and force the group to do this
- Any member of [[The Bog Tribe]] who joins a group that hunts or seeks, automatically vouches for that group to be worthy of [[The Bog Tribe]]. Then they must complete the ritual if they ever return to [[The Bog Tribe]]. If they fail, the Tribe member who joined them is banned from the tribe for a decade and they are all banished from [[The Bogbeast Swamps]]. A success binds them all to [[The Bog Tribe]] as honorary members.
