AI Art of The Black-Tide Reaper's water-front headquarters: ![[Hope town black tide reapers.png]]

> *As you approach you hear the low, sonorous sound of bagpipes playing. As you glance at the harbor front, you see massive, colorful sea creatures, the likes of which you've never seen before, strewn across the docks. Massive trawlers lay docked in the harbor and fearsome, black pirate ships with harpoons bristling from their decks lay ready in wait for trouble. Their is a serious undertone; people move with efficiency and purpose. The massive buildings look to be made of stone, and resemble a large mansion and castle hybrid.*
