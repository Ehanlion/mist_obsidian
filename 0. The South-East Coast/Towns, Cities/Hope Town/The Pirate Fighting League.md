PFL for short, the Pirate Fighting League is the league made by pirates for single or mixed combat. Fights occur in [[Hugo's Arena]]. The league was founded by a man named [[Hugo the Great]]. He had the arena named after him, but since pirates are simple-minded folks, they figured they would just name the league, the Pirate Fighting League. 

The League supports 1v1s and 4v4s. 1v1s are much more prestigious and 4v4 competitions are usually unnecessarily bloody and violent. Every year, many 1v1 competitions get run but only one 4v4 competition (called the yearly brawl) takes place. The two combat forms have much different rules, with 1v1s being very based on audience favor while 4v4s are all about raw combat power. 
# 1v1 Rules:
A 1v1 in the PFL is as much a fight as it is a performance. You of course, fight to win but just defeating you opponent will not score you a victory. Pirates enjoy a spectacle so you have to entertain them. Winners of 1v1s get to move on in the competitions and losers either die or are removed from competition. Each 1v1 you win earns you a small amounts of prize money and the larger competition usually has a prize of gold and magic items. Of course, that means that 1v1s have antes, and they are usually steep. 
#### Rules:
- A fight must last longer than 3 rounds of combat. Even if this means pulling your punches, you cannot end before this or you may be killed immediately.
	- Of course, if you are caught pulling punches, you will be disciplined. Feigning a fight is as bad as finishing it to quickly. You have to deceive the watcher if you are trying to prolong a fight. 
- If you kill an opponent, they are merely downed. You cannot kill them. The crowd will vote on whether the defeated lives or dies. This will be done based of their performance in combat.
	- Making flamboyant attacks, moving in unique ways, and using unexpected methods to attack your opponent will give you favor with the crowd.
	- How reputable you are can help or hurt you here.

### Favor:
Favor is the metric which stops you from dying from public vote, if you are downed in combat. Here is how the system works:

**Earning favor**: Your reputation can give you a standing 'level' of favor. This number, positive or negative, will contribute to the number of successful performance rolls that you will need to make to avoid execution. *If the judges are paid by a member of a rival faction, it may hurt you if they realize you are allied with your faction.* 

**Performance:** Every time you make an attack in a 1v1, you will roll some performance check. This check is made for the entire turn. So it is made based on what you do for the turn. Successful flamboyance will grant advantage on the check, fumbling or doing something clumsy will give you disadvantage. If you land a massive hit (critical) you automatically succeed on a check. If you miss everything and do no damage on your turn, you gain disadvantage on the check.

**Not Dying:** You need to succeed a number of checks equal to half the number of transpired round, rounded up. If a fight lasts 5 rounds, you need to succeed on 3 checks. The crowd sentiment matters in deciding this, which is the purpose of the favor system. 

At the end of the fight, spectators will show something white to indicate that they hope the downed is saved and red if they hope the downed is executed. The judges will determine based on the majority of the crowds vote. If the downed is deemed executable, their opponent finishes the job. If the opponent refuses, they are both executed.
