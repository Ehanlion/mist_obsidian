AI Art of Hugo's Arena: ![[Hope town hugos arena.png]]
Note that there would not usually be massive ships in here, that's just how the art got generated. Usually the center is filled with a floating series of platforms to do battle on. 
### Hugo's Arena
> *Image the coliseum from Rome. Now imagine it filled with hundred of screaming pirates. That is Hugo's Arena: the battlegrounds of the Pirate Fighting League. The center is flooded by salty sea water, and on it today floats a banged up shit. It is tethered to the sides of the arena with thick ropes. You can hear the clashing of metal on metal as two pirates duke it out on the main deck. Pirates, civilians, pretty much everyone actually, is cheering viciously as the fight continues. When one pirate falls, you see most people in the arena hold up something white and wave it in the air. The defeated pirate is given medical aid and carried off the ship on a stretcher.*

This is a medium sized area used to host fights for [[The Pirate Fighting League]]. The stands rise high up with upper decks for more wealthy patrons separated from the main levels. The center of the arena is filled from the ocean and on it float the terrain which combat occurs on. It changes with each tournament. Sometimes it is a full pirate ship. Other times it is just floating wooden platforms that pirates have to balance on.

**A note about the water:** The water is usually calm, but there exist large paddles every 45 degrees around the outside, at water level. They can be controlled from below the arena by the hosts of the tournament. If operated, they can be used to procure large swells and choppy water in the arena to add to the difficulty of the fighting conditions. 

### Entering the Arena:
It costs 5 GP for most matches, but for special tournaments, the cost can go up higher. People will still pay it of course. The spectacle is well worth the cost. 

### The Faction Influence:
[[The Black-Tide Reapers]] are currently the sanctioned hosts of the arena, so they take a hefty cut of all profits from the arena. It is also their enforcers that watch over and police the arena during fights. They allow quite a high level of violence, fighting, and turbulence in the audience. They won't stand for killing but anything short of that is usually tolerated. If you are caught in violation of this, or in general just causing a disturbance, they may ask for a 'donation' to forget about the incident. Obviously, this is extortion, but no one can stop them and not paying would mean you get banned from all events indefinitely.
