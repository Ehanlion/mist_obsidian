> *The bustling noises hit you before you see their source. You smell the spicy aroma of smoking meats and hear jaunty playing of pirate shanties. The waterfront is abuzz with women watching their children play and pirates loading and unloading goods from ships. The buildings here are made from warm woods, but look to be in disrepair. Some buildings have collapsed roofs, now covered with old sails. You can seen multiple pirate ships being scrapped for their wood to repair a larger building on the waterfront.*
