Subsection: New, alter-ego for [[Ignel Valis]]
# An Alter Ego:
[[Ignel Valis]] feigned his death, somewhat correctly described within [[The Greatest of the Great]]. In the act of doing so, he created an alter ego, calling himself [[Silvan Gile]], an anagram of his original name [[Ignel Valis]]. He sought to escape the unreachable standards the world had grown to hold him to and to take his revenge, slowly but surely, on those who pushed is identity out of his own reach. 

[[Ignel Valis]] suffered from imposter syndrome and inadequacy. His own tales made upping the ante increasingly difficult until it became impossible to achieve. Whenever [[Ignel Valis]] would perform a great, but seemingly lesser, act of heroism he would be ridiculed by those who once loved him. They called him a fake, a fraud, and a disappointment. To escape, [[Ignel Valis]] feigned his death with help from [[Garrick Blackthorn]] during their fight with [[Agnedelo the Plague-Bringer]]. 
# The Public Knowledge
In [[The Greatest of the Great]], it is important to know they lines between what was told in story versus what actually happened. This distinction is detailed in the notes for the book. Long story short, [[Ignel Valis]] told [[Garrick Blackthorn]] to commission someone to tell the tale of [[Ignel Valis]]'s death and then [[Ignel Valis]] assumed a new identity as [[Silvan Gile]].
