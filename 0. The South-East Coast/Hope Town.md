This is the largest town along [[The South-East Coast]]. It is led by three bandit organizations, each headed by a group of leaders and a Pirate King. The separate factions control regions of the city, and therefore control types of markets within the city. 

# City Markets:
These are the different markets present within the city. There is a lot of underground trade as well as smaller exchanges but only the major import/exports of the city are listed below. 

**Markets:**
- Rare gems/minerals/ores e.g. mining market
- Timber and wood imports.
- Fishing and sea-going trade.
- Deep-sea creatures and dangerous creatures trade.
- The dueling competition and league in the city.
- Alcohol and spirits production + exports as well as imports. 

# How trade works:
All artisans work for a specific faction. That faction buys their goods and then distributes them to anyone. The goods will be sold to any faction, but the price is solely determined by the faction that sells them. A commodity like food is a powerful one to control since everyone needs food, giving the sellers a lot of market power.

Sometimes, factions will try to bypass this system by getting the goods on their own. This is both a death sentence for anyone who helps the faction and a death sentence for the faction. Both other factions will push heavy consequences onto the violating faction, if they can.
