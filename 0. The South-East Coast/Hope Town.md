This is the largest town along [[The South-East Coast]]. Parts of the city are controlled by powerful, pirate factions called [[The Blue Coat Brigade]], [[The Black-Tide Reapers]], and the fearsome [[Fedorov's Legion]]. Each faction controls some of the trade in the city. Normal people in the city can live in faction protected territory or live on the outskirts with no faction protection. Not everyone is an explicit member of a faction, but people do play favorites. It is a town of pirates after all. 

# Demographics:
Hope Town is wildly diverse. You can be anything you want here and you can be anyone you want to be. Apart from strict regulations on trade, the city is mostly unregulated apart from specific rules to each factions territory. 
### Occupations:
There are many popular occupations in the city but what follows are some of the more bespoke ones. Remember, this is still a city, there are the normal professions that come with a city being a city.
> #### Hope Town Specific Occupations:
> - **Faction Enforcer:** 
> 	- The 'police' that each faction has to enforce its rules within its territory.
> - **Fleet Pirate:** 
> 	- Sailors, pirates, or corsairs that sail for a given faction. Every faction has a fleet of ships and those ships are sailed by faction-allied pirates.
> - **Faction Merchant:** 
> 	- Merchants who work for factions. These merchants have to pay taxes to factions that regulate the trades that they deal with. 

## Races and Peoples:
The city is the most diverse on the island of Mist. It combines people from every region of the map, of every race, and of every upbringing and heritage. Most come from [[The South-East Coast]] because this is where Hope Town is located and the coast is slightly cutoff. However, people from all over funnel into the city through the mountain passes, and over time the city has grown into a rich jewel on the backs of its diversity. 

You can find any race/class combination in this city. There is a 0% chance you cannot find someone that you can imagine, that's how diverse the city is. 

# City Markets:
These are the different markets present within the city. There is a lot of underground trade as well as smaller exchanges but only the major import/exports of the city are listed below.
> #### **Generic Markets**:
> There are multiple generic markets that anyone can import without regulation. A market is only considered 'unregulated' if it 100% vital to every citizen, regardless of chosen faction. 
> - Farming
> - Fishing and Generic Products of the Sea
> - Water and Irrigation
> - Ship-building market

> #### **Faction Markets**:
> The other market are all 'regulated' by factions. The merchants who import, export, and sell these good have to go through the faction that supports that specific trade.
> - Spices and Exotic foods
> - Monstrous Sea Creatures and Exotic Animals
> - Medicine, Herbal Remedies, and Potions
> - Magical Items, Armor, and Weapons
> - Stolen Artifacts and Rare Curios
> - Alcohol and Spirits
> - Lumber and Forestry
> - Gems, Jewels, and Mining Resources
> - The Foundry (e.g. weapons, forged goods, etc.)

Of course, lets not forget that this is, in fact, a city made of pirates. While there is order, that does not mean that factions get along well. There is stiff competition for which faction controls which trade. There is also a rich black market for non-sanctioned goods. Of course, all factions deny this, but they all utilize the market.
# How trade works:
Some trades are unregulated, namely the trade of necessaries like food and water. No one faction regulates this trade, but rather normal supply and demand causes the prices to fluctuate. Other trades however, are regulated by specific factions. Anyone hoping to be a *sanctioned* importer of a good or resource must do so through the faction that owns that trade. The merchant declares their imports with the faction and pays a tax to them to sell their goods. They then sell their goods under the banner of that faction. A merchant can import multiple different products, but they will have to pay tax to every faction that controls a trade they are importing.

If a merchant works for a faction, that merchant can choose to sell their entire cargo to the faction that controls the trade. 

Now, inevitably, merchants and factions will try to import goods illegally e.g. subverting the taxes factions levy against a specific trade. These goods could only be sold to normal consumers at the black market or sold directly to a competing faction (that the merchant most likely works for). HOWEVER, this is not without consequence. If a factions enforcers find a merchant in non-compliance, the penalty is death (and no faction will defend them because it admits guilt to the faction, which would demand heavy peace offerings from the offending faction).
### Isn't it weird to work for a faction and sell to rivals?
Yes and No. Remember, the merchants only work for a faction because they have to. Their income is made from selling. Maybe some merchants will only sell to one faction or be allied to one, but most will sell to the highest bidder because they need to make money.

# Important Places and Landscape:
Hope Town is large, enough to house three competing factions and people with room to spare. There are a couple notable locations in the city that serve as commerce hubs and popular locations. However before talking about locations, lets talk about the structure of the city. 

## City Structure:
The city has three main bays, one for each faction. Then there is a central bay, called [[The Bay of Trade]]. If you can imagine it, [[The Blue Coat Brigade]] and [[The Black-Tide Reapers]] share one side of the city, their bays distinct but next to each-other. Their side is then divided from the bay controlled by [[Fedorov's Legion]] by [[The Bay of Trade]]. Thus there are four bays. The three for each faction are small and [[The Bay of Trade]] is quite large. 

Now for the important locations in the city. There will only be a few. The GM should add random shops and such as this location is played through. It would take to much time to add every single small shop, but there are shops for everything here. 
### The Green Stacks:
>*The smell of dirt, fresh fruits and fragrant veggies, and fish twist in the air as you walk closer to the green stacks. You can hear bartering and chirping of merchants bickering with customers. The shouts of enforcers and the stamping of their boots are apparent as you can see flashes of weapons brandished against offenders.*

This it the central food market in the city. Yes the two main markets are separate. The Green Stacks are a multitiered collection of 'stacks,' located directly on the water front of [[The Bay of Trade]]. Farmers, who farm outside the town bring their goods to market here and fishermen who bring in large catches of generic fish sail their ships up to the docks of the market to sell. Any generic food item that you could think of could be found here. Spices and exotic resources are sold at the Great Market, not here. 

All factions have representation here since this is a communal area. As such, enforcers from each faction watch over the market together. This is one of the few places where the factions will work together. They have an understanding that, since they (in the end), are all pirates that they at least need to work together to keep the market a safe place for the trade of food. 
### The Great Market:
>*There is no quick way to describe what greets you as you step into the great market. The vastness is the first thing to greet you: three massive circular tiers rise up into the sky. Coverings and tents of every shape and color crowd each tier as merchants have their shops setup. The very top tier has an awning covering it so the stalls there look more permanent and well made. It is loud. Very loud. Merchant yell into the crowds offering their wares and consumers shout and banter with them in return. You see enforcers representing each faction; here the are separated between rings, each defending their territory. *

This is the central market in the city. It is huge. Every merchant in the city tries to sell their wares here. Every trade is represented in the market, so it is pretty easy to find everything you could want here. If imagining this place, envision a stadium where each level represents a different faction. The upper, outer ring is covered by vaulted, shading fabric to shield it from the weather. The other levels are not so lucky. 

Unlike the Green Stacks, the Great Market is NOT a communal area. Enforcers only guard the areas that merchants who sell a good represented by their faction work. The market itself is divided into three rings, each at a different level. [[The Blue Coat Brigade]] sells on the lowest level, [[The Black-Tide Reapers]] sell on the middle level, and [[Fedorov's Legion]] sell on the highest level.
