### The Great Market:
>*There is no quick way to describe what greets you as you step into the great market. The vastness is the first thing to greet you: three massive circular tiers rise up into the sky. Coverings and tents of every shape and color crowd each tier as merchants have their shops setup. The very top tier has an awning covering it so the stalls there look more permanent and well made. It is loud. Very loud. Merchant yell into the crowds offering their wares and consumers shout and banter with them in return. You see enforcers representing each faction; here the are separated between rings, each defending their territory. *

This is the central market in the city. It is huge. Every merchant in the city tries to sell their wares here. Every trade is represented in the market, so it is pretty easy to find everything you could want here. If imagining this place, envision a stadium where each level represents a different faction. The upper, outer ring is covered by vaulted, shading fabric to shield it from the weather. The other levels are not so lucky. 

Unlike the Green Stacks, the Great Market is NOT a communal area. Enforcers only guard the areas that merchants who sell a good represented by their faction work. The market itself is divided into three rings, each at a different level. [[The Blue Coat Brigade]] sells on the lowest level, [[The Black-Tide Reapers]] sell on the middle level, and [[Fedorov's Legion]] sell on the highest level.
