Regional Location: [[The South-East Coast]]
Subsection: Expansion of [[The Black Guard]] and [[The Black Baron's Keep]]

# Explanation:
If [[The Black Guard]], in the name of [[Baroness Von Azarov]] of [[The Black Baron's Keep]] manage to take over and control [[The Sprawls]], the North-Easternly target of their expansion, then the well being of [[The South-East Coast]] is doomed.

[[The Black Guard]] evolves into [[The Cutthroat Authority]] and will seek to destroy [[Hope Town]] and the pirate factions that inhabit it.
