This is a great book regarding the adventures of [[Ignel Valis]]. The book ends with the tragic tale of his demise as he fought an Ancient Black Dragon named [[Fenrix the Plague-Bringer]]. The story tells the great tales of his mighty deeds. 

### The Great Draconic Fight:
The greatest of all Ignel's deeds was killing Fenrix. It was a great battle that occurred deep in [[The Dark Woods]]. It was a gruesome fight, seeing the minions of both [[Ignel Valis]] and [[Garrick Blackthorn]] killed in the fight. In the final moments, [[Ignel Valis]] was defeated by [[Fenrix the Plague-Bringer]] but not before striking a fatal blow to the great dragon. [[Garrick Blackthorn]] was the only person to walk away from the fight. 

### The Rest of the Book:
I don't know man, maybe have players that look up to Ignel *create* some of his deed that they think could have inspired them.
