Subsection: Event after [[The Moon-Fall Resurgence]]
# Description:
Once per year, on the day directly after [[The Moon-Fall Resurgence]], [[Amides]] (the moon of Mist), rises in a brilliant red color. It empowers the undead and influence from [[The Betrayer Gods]], making their followers incredibly powerful.
# Mechanics of the Buff:
All creatures drawing their energy from influence of [[The Betrayer Gods]] are empowered under the light of [[Amides]] and The Red Glow. 

Any instance of damage dealt by creatures with influence from [[The Betrayer Gods]] increased by 1d12 of necrotic damage as the moon corrupts and empowers their strikes. Casters can cast a number of spells equal to their proficiency bonus without expending a spell slot as the moon augments their magic. Martial characters are able to attack once extra per attack action as the moon imbues them with swiftness.
