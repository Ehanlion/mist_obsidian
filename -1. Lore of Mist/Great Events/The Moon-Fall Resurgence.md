# Description:
Every 100 years, the moon called [[Amides]] perfectly aligns with the peak of [[Mount Starlight]]. When this happens, the lunar energy flows into the stone of [[Mount Starlight]]. The mountain glows with faint light and the power from [[Amides]] seeps into the lands of [[The Twilight Woods]].
