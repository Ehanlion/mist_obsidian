Regional Location: The first settlers of Mist
Subsection: Escaped [[The Runewilds]] and [[The Scintillating Order]] after killing the Queen of [[The Runewilds]]. 
# Who are the Many?
The Many are a powerful group of eight mages and architects that originally lived in [[The Runewilds]]. They were oppressed and enslaved by [[The Scintillating Order]] for years before [[Faustus]] (alongside [[Marwood]]), their now leader, killed the Queen of [[The Runewilds]] during a festival celebration. The Many escaped, named [[Faustus]] their leader and [[Marwood]] their second in command, and fled for a safe haven. They travelled on a sky-ship that [[Faustus]] prepared ahead of time. 

The members of The Many:
1. [[Faustus]] (leader of the group)
2. [[Marwood]] (second in command)
3. [[Bernhard]]
4. [[Cleophas]]
5. [[DeAngelo]]
6. [[Mansfield]]
7. [[Sprague]]
8. [[Valentino]]
9. A hierarchy was not formed until **after** The Many escaped the clutches of [[The Scintillating Order]] and killed the queen. 
# Where did they come from?
The Many originate from [[The Runewilds]]. They are lands that now, with [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]] protecting Mist and [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] sealing Mist off onto its own demi-plane, that are unreachable by any means. If Mist were ever to be brought back to the Prime Material plane, it would reside thousands of miles from [[The Runewilds]].

[[The Runewilds]] were actually very similar in resources to Mist. Special and rare things findable within Mist are also findable within [[The Runewilds]]. Since both Mist and [[The Runewilds]] were once part of the same plane of the Prime Material, the same flora and fauna as well as creatures are present in both Mist now and [[The Runewilds]]. 
# Why did they come to Mist
This is detailed within the notes about [[The Runewilds]]. However, in summary, The Many were mentally enslaved by a group known as [[The Scintillating Order]] (a group that leads [[The Runewilds]] and is lead itself by the monarchy and the Queen). [[Faustus]] and [[Marwood]] broke the group free from [[The Scintillating Order]] and The Many escaped. [[Faustus]] knew about Mist before hand and the group sailed there on a sky-ship. 
# How could they create such creations?
The Many were considered master magic wielders -- and master architects. They were the architects in [[The Runewilds]] and built powerful weapons and invention that could be used to fight and destroy neighboring civilizations. 
# What locations tie back to them?
It is beyond important to note that the citizens of Mist do not understand that the locations listed here have any ties to The Many. In fact almost all of people on Mist have no idea who or what The Many are. The few that have any idea are disregarded as crazy. 

The following locations were created by [[The Many]] in the time between first landing on the island and [[The Final Day of The Many]]. 
1. [[The Obelisk Field]]: A field of obelisks now located in the sea off the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]].
2. [[The Solemn Flutes]]: A series of odd stone rings located in [[The Discordant Plains]]. Originally created as just a passion project and to echo a lovely sound across [[The Discordant Plains]]. 
3. [[Bunker 1]]: Houses [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] and [[The Mist Codex]]. Ancient stone bunker submerged under the water level along the west coast of [[The Harmonious Sea]] and [[The North-West Highlands]]
