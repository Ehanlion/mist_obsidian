# Description:
The Runewilds were the lands that [[The Many]] originated from. They are an abundantly magical place where fantastical creatures, beasts, and people roam. There are majestic cities of such outstanding design that they would baffle even the most open-minded of people on Mist. Grand projects, inventions, and creations dot the landscapes of the The Runewilds.

The society was advanced too; with powerful engines, sky-ships, floating islands, and train-like transportation. An abundance of knowledge was discovered and preserved by this long-standing society. Primitive computers could automate spell castings, modify the ethereal net of spell energy to produce strange effects, and alter the effects, durations, and ranges of existing spells to suit the needs of the designers. 
# Running the Society and the Roles of [[The Many]]:
The society was run as a monarchy with a reigning Queen. The monarchy was the head of an elite group who ran the entirety of The Runewilds. This group was known as [[The Scintillating Order]]. Powerful and well liked, the group brought prosper, good tidings, and fortune to the lands of The Runewilds. However, they did not do it alone; in a shady, despicable twist, [[The Scintillating Order]]'s success actually hinged upon the mind-slaving of eight elite mages and architects known as [[The Many]]. 

The members of [[The Many]] enslaved by [[The Scintillating Order]]:
1. [[Faustus]] (leader of the group)
2. [[Marwood]] (second in command)
3. [[Bernhard]]
4. [[Cleophas]]
5. [[DeAngelo]]
6. [[Mansfield]]
7. [[Sprague]]
8. [[Valentino]]
9. A hierarchy was not formed until **after** [[The Many]] escaped the clutches of [[The Scintillating Order]] and killed the queen. 

[[The Many]] had superior intellect, capabilities in the arcane, and design mastery. This made them unrivaled architects and inventors. They were the most productive, powerful, and change-bringing group in all of The Runewilds. 

It was for this reason that [[The Scintillating Order]] saw fit to slave them to the mind of the queen of The Runewilds in order to make them productive servants to the realm. For years, they worked for [[The Scintillating Order]] and through their devices and inventions, the realm prospered into the advanced, developed realm that it became. 
#### The Many Escape:
However, at some point, the mind-hold placed over [[The Many]], specifically on the members named [[Faustus]] (Faustus means lucky in Latin, so it's fitting) and [[Marwood]] failed, giving them control back over their minds and their wills. They feign submission and silently worked to destroy [[The Scintillating Order]] and The Queen for their transgressions. They staged a great assassination of the queen during the yearly celebration of the realm, broke the mind-hold over the rest of [[The Many]] and lead them to a sky-ship that they had prepared and modified. The group escaped as [[The Scintillating Order]] reeled at the destruction to the realm caused by the fleeing group. [[Faustus]] was named the leader and [[Marwood]] was labelled second in command for their heroics in saving the group and breaking them free of the clutches of [[The Scintillating Order]]. 
#### The Reponses:
Of course, [[The Scintillating Order]] labelled [[The Many]] as traitors and that they, at any cost to the realm, were to be hunted and killed. No matter how long it took, [[The Scintillating Order]] vowed that The Runewilds would see [[The Many]] dead and brought to justice. If only the citizen of The Runewilds could've known the heinous deeds [[The Scintillating Order]] did towards [[The Many]]. If they had known, perhaps they wouldn't have backed [[The Scintillating Order]] the joint council of The Runewilds, giving them master power over the realm.
