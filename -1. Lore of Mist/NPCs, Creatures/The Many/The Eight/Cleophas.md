# Role in [[The Many]]:
[[Cleophas]] was the lead agricultural developer for [[The Many]]. Cleophas was one of only two druids in the group, with the second one being [[DeAngelo]]. [[Cleophas]] was responsible for creating orchards, fields, and growing regions on some of the more desolate parts of the island. She was responsible for categorizing all plant varieties and species on the island and learning what they all did. She, with the help of [[DeAngelo]], would try to breed and develop new plants that were not naturally found on the island in order to give [[The Many]] a wider variety of resources to work with.
