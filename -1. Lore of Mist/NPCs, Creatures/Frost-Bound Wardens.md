Regional Location: In the seas of Mist
Subsection: Wander deep within [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]
# True Nature:
The true nature of the Wardens are that they are constructs, powered by [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] and can be shutdown via [[The Mist Codex]]. They are a feature that is enabled within [[The Mist Codex]] to provide a layer of defense. 
# Description:
Massive sentinels the sizes of buildings. Their arms the sizes of ships. Their glowing, blue icy eyes, like giant pools of water. Their arms, as they move in the seas, create giant whirlpools and eddies and miniature waterfalls form from their stone crevices. Ice clings to every part of their bodies. They move with a lethargic and deliberate movements 
# Living in the Shroud:
The Wardens only live in [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]. They do not venture out for any reason. Myth has it that they feed on the mists itself, regenerating it constantly. They mark the end of the worlds in Mist. It is said that, while dangerous, the Wardens are there to stop one from sailing off the edge of the world into the abyss of nothing. 
# Getting past the FBW:
The Wardens have poor vision and sense things by movement rather than sight. However their ability to detect vibrations using tremor sense is remarkable, to say the least. It requires extreme caution and silence to sneak past the Wardens. Some have tried, none have succeeded in making it past the Wardens. If you do make it past though, you encounter the phenomenon (detailed within [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]) of essentially 'sailing around the world.'
# Combat with the FBW:
Few have made it deep enough within [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]] to actually bear witness to the Wardens themselves. Only a few who did lived to tell the tale. The only living people who could describe a Warden live in [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]] (an island off [[The North-West Highlands]] in [[The Distant Sea]]). 

Wardens have the siege property which is all they need to dispatch ships with easy. With their exceedingly powerful arms and massive stature, the Wardens simply smash any ships that try to sail through the waters. With that said, their massive size makes their attacks seem lethargic. This is the only factor that may help a captain avoid destruction. A smart helmsman will wait to see where the Wardens aim to smash and sail around it just as the arms are being brough down. Misjudge your course, and you will die in the frosty waters of [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]].
