# Description:
Massive, sentinels the sizes of buildings. Their arms the sizes of ships. Their glowing, blue icy eyes, like giant pools of water. Their arms, as the move in the seas create giant whirlpools and eddies and miniature waterfalls form from the stone crevices in their massive arms. Ice clings to every part of their bodies. 

# Living in the Shroud:
The Wardens only live in [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]. They do not venture out for any reason. Myth has it that they feed on the mists itself, regenerating it constantly. They mark the end of the worlds in Mist. In reality, they are powered by [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] and can be shutdown via [[The Mist Codex]]. 

# How to get past:
The only way past is to not make noise. A ship making any noise cannot sail through the waters un-touched. This is not easy on a ship of all things. Furthermore, the mists are dark and if a ship uses any light in them, they will easily be spotted. So in short, make no noise and use no light.
