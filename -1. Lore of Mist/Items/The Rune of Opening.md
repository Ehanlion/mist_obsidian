A runic symbol that looks like the following:

O - - - - - - O -
O - - O - - O - O
O - - - - - - O -

It is an ancient symbol that when activated can open certain passage ways that are inscribed with the symbol. Runic engravings near the rune usually key it to other runes, linking them. Empowering one run can empower the other, opening passage ways. 

this is a variant called the rune of keying, a subset of the rune of opening.

# Important usages:
1. [[The Obelisk Field]] off the North and Wests coasts of [[The North-West Highlands]] and residing in [[The Harmonious Sea]] and [[The Distant Sea]] is formed in the shape of the rune of opening. While some of the obelisks are below the sea level, if one is to plot all of their locations (both the submerged and visible ones), it becomes apparent that they are laid out in the form of the rune of opening. When all of the obelisks within [[The Obelisk Field]] are powered, the rune surges with energy and unlocks the door to [[Bunker 1xNWH]], a bunker of [[The Many]] that is hidden below the water line and against the western, white cliffs of [[The North-West Highlands]].
