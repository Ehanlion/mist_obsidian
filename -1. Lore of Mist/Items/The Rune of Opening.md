A runic symbol that looks like the following:

O - - - - - - O -
O - - O - - O - O
O - - - - - - O -

It is an ancient symbol that when activated can open certain passage ways that are inscribed with the symbol. Runic engravings near the rune usually key it to other runes, linking them. Empowering one run can empower the other, opening passage ways. 

this is a variant called the rune of keying, a subset of the rune of opening.
