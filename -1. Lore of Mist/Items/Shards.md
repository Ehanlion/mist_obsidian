# What are shards:
They are Keys, a part of the legacy left by [[The Many]]. Shards are what the few who even know about [[The Many]] call the ancient artifacts they imbued with power. [[The Many]] called them keys. 

# The Distinction between Shards and Keys:
In texts written by [[The Many]], the 'Shards' are called 'Keys' since that is their name to [[The Many]]. However, in any discussion outside of texts, carvings, and direct messages left by [[The Many]], 'Keys' are strictly referred to as 'Shards,' and there is no idea of the names 'Keys' known to anyone on Mist.

# Properties:
The monuments on Mist are controlled with ancient constructions known to The Many as 'Keys.' They are powerful artifacts of various shapes. There where-abouts and descriptions are as follows:

| Key Number | Location | Description | Ability | Memory |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Key 1 | Already powering an obelisk. | Appears are a small, blue sphere with burning orange fire inside of it. | When bound to a weapon, wielder can deal an additional 1d6 fire damage to a target, once per turn. | ??? |
| Key 2 | Held as a prized piece by [[Ignel Valis]] and is embedded within his staff. | Appears as a small, vibrating blue ethereal key. | When bound to an item of spell-caster, wielder's intelligence increases by 2. | ??? |
| Key 3 | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? |
| Key 4 | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? |
| Key 5 | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? |
| Key 6 | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? |
| Key 7 | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? |
| Key 8 | ??? | ??? | ??? | ??? |

There are 8 keys -- each different. 

# Memory Fragments:
Each one of the shards has inside of it, an ancient memory stored from its owner. When a creature touches the shard for the first time, or any time after that point if they concentrate, that creature can tap into the memory stored within the shard. This might be a small recollection of how the shard was used, a personal memory whilst on the island, or something more revealing about the actual usage of the shard -- you choose Ethan!
