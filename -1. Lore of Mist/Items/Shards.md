# What are shards:
They are Keys, a part of the legacy left by [[The Many]]. Shards are what the few who even know about [[The Many]] call the ancient artifacts they imbued with power. [[The Many]] called them keys. 

# The Distinction between Shards and Keys:
In texts written by [[The Many]], the 'Shards' are called 'Keys' since that is their name to [[The Many]]. However, in any discussion outside of texts, carvings, and direct messages left by [[The Many]], 'Keys' are strictly referred to as 'Shards,' and there is no idea of the names 'Keys' known to anyone on Mist.

# Properties:
The monuments on Mist are controlled with ancient constructions known to The Many as 'Keys.' They are powerful artifacts of various shapes. There where-abouts and descriptions are as follows:
