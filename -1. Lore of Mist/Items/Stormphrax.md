# Description: 
A gemstone of pure, untouched lightning. Formed when a lightning bold strikes into the earth, Stormphrax is rare and sought after. It glows with a light like no other and has a rare property of becoming unimaginably heavy if left in pure darkness. 
# Formation:
When lightning strikes the ground, it can begin to crystallize underneath the earth. As it hardens, from pure energy into a crystal, it begins to grow heavy and dense. This transformation causes it to sink deep down, penetrating through stone and dirt until it rests at equilibrium very deep in the earth. There, in darkness, it lies until it can be mined.
# Mining and Extracting:
Unlike most other ores, Stormphrax must be extracted in the light of twilight. In day light, it becomes unstable and explosive whilst in darkness it is heavy beyond imagination. Only in perfect twilight can it be extracted. This makes it exceedingly rare, unbelievably expensive, and dangerous.
# Usage:
Stormphrax has a number of usages, but its two main ones are in healing and in weaponry:

**Healing with Stormphrax:**
Stormphrax, in careful dosages, can me mixed with healing potions. Too much added and the potion can kill its drinker and too little added is just a waste. If a perfect amount is added, it changes the healing dice from a d4 to a d10. A healing potion made in this manner is now called a 'Phrax-addled' potion and costs **5x** the original amount.

**Weapons with Stormphrax:**
A weapon with Stormphrax imbued into the metal adds an additional 1d6 lightning damage to the attacks with the weapons. It also causes the weapon to glow dimly for 10 feet as if casting the area into a bluish twilight.
