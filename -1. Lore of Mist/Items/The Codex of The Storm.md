Regional Description: [[The South-East Coast]]
Subsection: Codex to summon the storm of [[The Storm Lord]]
# Description:
An ancient text that contains passages and scripture relating to [[The Storm Lord]]. It is a thick, large book and the pages inside are dense and intricately inscribed with gilded text, ocean motifs, and flashing storms. Some of the pages have moving images depicting a great storm or interpretations of what [[The Storm Lord]] looks like to them. 
# Ritual Texts:
The book has a ritual in it that spans many pages detailing the long and arduous process of summoning [[The Calamitous Typhoon]], the prophesized storm of [[The Storm Lord]]. The texts show violent images of shifting storms attacking the coasts of Mist. On pages there are eyes staring back at you as you read the pages and they appear to follow you. 
# Reading the Ritual:
To read the ritual requires numerous conditions to be satisfied:
1. **Charisma:** A creature needs at least 13 charisma
2. **Alignment:** Since the ritual summons a devastating storm, your character cannot be Neutral or Lawful Good Aligned.
3. **Language:** The ritual texts can only be read by someone that can read Celestial.
4. **Religion:** The ritual texts require, in their preamble that anyone who wishes to pursue reading them swear off all other divine influence for all of time. That means no devotion or alignment to any god, deity, or powerful being. 
# The Location of the Codex:
The codex was an ancient artifact, one that was stored in the library of [[The Blue Coat Brigade]] in [[Hope Town]]. It is a jealously guarded artifact and one that requires the utmost of confidence from [[Pavel Hard]] to be told about.
