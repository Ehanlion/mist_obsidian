# Who are the Many?
It is said that a group was first to settle Mist, over 10,000 years ago. They are called by the few historians of Mist who still care, The Many. There is precious little known about them other than that there are still some lingering remnants of their time on Mist scattered around the island. 

Founder of Mist over 5,000 years ago. 

# Where did they come from?

# How could they create such creations?

# What locations tie back to them?
Okay Ethan, don't be dumb. These location are NOT explicitly known. This is just the full list of all the locations that link back to The Many.
1. [[The Obelisk Field]]: A field of obelisks now located in the sea off the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]].
2. [[The Solemn Flutes]]: A series of odd stone rings located in [[The Discordant Plains]].

# The Keys:
The monuments on Mist are controlled with ancient constructions known to The Many as 'Keys.' They are powerful artifacts of various shapes. There where-abouts and descriptions are as follows:

| Key Number | Location | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Key 1 | Already powering an obelisk. | Appears are a small, blue sphere with burning orange fire inside of it. |
| Key 2 | Held as a prized piece by [[Ignel Valis]] and is embedded within his staff. | Appears as a small, vibrating blue ethereal key. |
| Key 3 | ??? | ??? |
| Key 4 | ??? | ??? |
| Key 5 | ??? | ??? | 
| Key 6 | ??? | ??? |
| Key 7 | ??? | ??? |
| Key 8 | ??? | ??? |

There are 8 keys -- each different. 

#### Important Terminology:
In documents by the Many and in locations relating to the many you can refer to them as 'powerful, magical keys' or just 'keys.' HOWEVER, those who are searching for them often know them as 'Shards' because this is how they have been referred to in history books.
