An artifact of how [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] function.

There are great seas surrounding Mist. Near the island, it makes sense that the depths of the sea is not too extreme -- the deepest of the shallows being just 300-500 feet in depth. 

However, as you sail beyond the island shallows, sailors have reported eerie feelings that the oceans seem to have no bottom at all. They would be right, just with no way of knowing it. If you were to travel down into the depths of the great seas, you would find that eventually you find yourself on [the elemental plane of water](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Plane_of_Water). You emerge at the depths of the plane and slowly, the deeper you swim, rise towards the surface of the plane. 

This occurrence is a mistake within the creation of [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] and a mistake in the coding of [[The Mist Codex]]. In all other ways, the creations are perfect, allowing no outside presence to ever step onto the lands of Mist -- exactly as intended by its creators, [[The Many]]. Except, if outsiders found a way to arrive from the elemental plane of water.
