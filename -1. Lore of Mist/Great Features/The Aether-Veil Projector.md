# Description:
A massive device created by [[The Many]] and controlled by the [[Shards]] (keys). It is a magical generator that projects a screen of mist to hide the island of Mist. 
# The layers of the veil:
The veil projects as layers of mist. There are increasingly colder, denser, and darker layers of the veil that are encountered the further one tries to sail into the veil. In the coldest layers live [[Frost-Bound Wardens]]. 

This phenomenon is known to the local people of Mist as [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]].
