# Description:
The shrouds are the barriers on the Mist-side of the field projected by the [[The Aether-Veil Projector]]. They stop any ship from making it through them. If a ship sails close to them, the temperature drops to icy levels. Sailing further, you could encounter titanic abominations of the sea; frosty creatures knows as [[Frost-Bound Wardens]]. If a ship can sail through this, the veil will transport them to the other side of the island.

E.g. a ship enters the shroud from the north of the islands and manage to miraculously sail through the freezing waters. They sail out of the shrouds into the waters at the south of the island. 

# Getting past the Wardens:
The [[Frost-Bound Wardens]] are fearsome, gigantic titans. They are not to be trifled with. Even a party of max level characters would stand no chance against these beings. 

# Locations of the shrouds:
The shrouds is NOT centered on the center point of the island of Mist but rather it is centered on [[The North-West Highlands]]. For this reason, the borders of the shroud are a lot closer to both [[The South-East Coast]] and [[The South-West Arid Expanse]]. This, combined with the natural occurrence of [[The Western Razor Peaks]] and [[The Southern Razor Peaks]] makes [[The South-East Mountains]] the only way to travel to [[The South-East Coast]].
