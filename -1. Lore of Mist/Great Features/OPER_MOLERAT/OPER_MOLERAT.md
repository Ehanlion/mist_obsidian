Subsection: Project for building control bunkers on Mist by [[The Many]]. 
# Description:
OPER_MOLERAT was the codename for the initiative ordered by [[Faustus]] as the leader of [[The Many]] to create defensible control bunkers all over the island of mist. Their purpose would be to control the various contraptions and mechanisms [[The Many]] were planning on building as well as providing key, defensive positions for each member of [[The Many]] to hide within. 
# The Center-Piece of the Operation:
At the operations heart, it saw that all bunkers would support [[Bunker 1xNWH]], since it would be the control center for the most important contraption [[The Many]] planned on building: [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] and its controls of [[The Mist Codex]]. 
# The Many and Their Bunkers:
Each member of [[The Many]] was assigned a bunker to build as their own defensive position. Some bunkers had multiple members of [[The Many]] assigned to it. The locations of the bunkers were assigned based on the specialties of [[The Many]]'s member(s) that would build them.
