Created by [[The Aether-Veil Projector]].

Somehow, someway, [[The Many]] who created [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] gave it the ability to block all divine presence on Mist. Divine influence is still possible e.g. clerics, warlocks, and paladins are still able to draw their power from divine sources. However, no divine deity can step foot on mist or show their form there. Only in dream and visions can they give their chosen champions glimpses of their visions.
