Ruling Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
Subsection: Old gods of Mist, replaced by the present [[The Pantheon of Mist]]
# Description:
The old gods are the traditional D&D 5e pantheon for the sword coast. Their names are not remembered apart from [[Grumbar]], the god of undisturbed mountains and wealth of the earth. He is the only special case from this group. The old gods (as they are referred to by historians of Mist), are defunct; they have no power nor influence over Mist and have been replaced by other gods, [[The Prime Deities]], and [[The Betrayer Gods]].
