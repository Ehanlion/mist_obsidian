A devil from beyond the island. Like to make a deal with adventurers. 

**Appearance**:
-  Is portly and fat. No other way about that.
-  Slimy green skin. Wears a translucent suit and holds a small, golden staff. 
-  Does not have legs, just has a sort of slimy tail thing for legs. 
-  Very Jabba the Hutt, if you can picture that. 

**The Deal**:
-  In exchange for their soul in the case where they do not deliver what he wants, he will give them access to various delicious booze recipes, craftable from seemingly anything. 
-  He requires that, every month, the taker of his deal gives him *new, interesting ingredients*, of which the number or quality are not specified, simply that Greg must be 'entertained.''
-  Other than that, he is a pretty laid back Devil. Just don't get on his bad side. He can make a powerful enemy.

Previously, Greg had a deal with both [[Pud Mountain-Breaker]] and [[Rexire Stormfellow]], but after years of good faith and a considerable amount of gold, they both bought their way out of servitude and were allowed to keep their special knowledge of magical, devilish drink creation.
