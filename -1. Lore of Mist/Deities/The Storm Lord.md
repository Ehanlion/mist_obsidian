*There are rainfalls and tempests and typhoons, but there is only one TRUE storm. Its rage is eternal. It dominates all lands and lives through all planes. It brings destruction to each one. The Storm Lord is the herald of this terrifying event. He carrying with him the souls of his champion; those who are brave enough to walk into his embrace will be saved as heroes by him forever.*

The Storm Lord is a multi-universal being. His power is not even comparable to any of the normal pantheon of gods that would be present in a setting like the Swords Coast. He chooses champions who's souls he will carry with him across dimensions, assuring those who walk with him have a place amidst his heroes forever.
