# Over-arching Idea:
I as a GM have often just brushed over languages, using exotic ones whenever I saw fit but I have realized that it is far cooler and more interesting to lock certain exotic languages to certain groups. That gives an air of 'knowing' whenever you find something in one of these exotic languages because it gives the impression that it ties to some larger group.
# The Exotic Languages:
| Language | Typical Speakers | Script | **Usage in Mist** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Abyssal | Demons | Infernal | Dark creatures of corruption and evil, cults of dark worship, and cryptic beings.  |
| Celestial | Celestials | Celestial | Followers of [[The Prime Deities]] |
| Draconic | Dragons, dragonborn | Draconic | Dragons, dragon cults, citizens of [[The South-West Arid Expanse]] and trades of [[The Scorchsand Wastes]] |
| Deep Speech | Aboleths, cloakers | Runic | [[The Many]] |
| Infernal | Devils | Infernal | Followers of [[The Betrayer Gods]] |
| Primordial | Elementals | Dwarvish | Cults of gods outside of [[The Prime Deities]] or [[The Betrayer Gods]] |
| Sylvan | Fey creatures | Elvish | Elves and forest creatures of [[The Green Order]] |
| Undercommon | Underworld traders | Elvish | Traders, merchants, and smugglers |
In my world, these languages will gain new meanings with who and what groups are inherently tied to them.

#### Abyssal
The language of darkness and foreboding. It is said that Abyssal is a corrupted form of Infernal and that Abyssal is a darker, more sinister language of the already dark dialect of Infernal. Cults worshipping dark creatures, [[The Syndicate of Ice]] as an example, speaks this cursed language. It is rumored that foul creatures living in the deepest of crevasse within [[The Under-Mountain Pass]] communicate in garbled remnants of Infernal, known as Abyssal. Abyssal is known as 'the language that not even [[The Betrayer Gods]] would speak' since it is a devolved form of their language, Infernal. 
#### Celestial:
Celestial is the chosen language in which worshippers of [[The Prime Deities]] write their scripture, songs, and teachings. In temples of [[The Prime Deities]], there will always be writing in Celestial that tells stories just for the devout, unreadable by those proficient only in the common tongues. Its flowing, angelic speech starkly constants the grating reverberations of Infernal, the language that all followers of [[The Prime Deities]] detest.
#### Draconic:
Obviously, Draconic is the language of dragons, of which there are many spread around the island of Mist. However, it is also a dominant language used in [[The South-West Arid Expanse]], specifically the parts near [[The South-East Mountains]] and in settlements on [[The Scorchsand Wastes]]. The brutal nature of draconic beasts and the history of their presence near [[The South-West Arid Expanse]] has rubbed off into the culture of that region, meaning many who dabble in fighting, readings, or trade there can speak the odd tongue of dragons. Of course, draconic beings like dragonborn, and the dragon-spawns of dragon cults write ritual texts in the language of their overlords.
#### Deep Speech:
Only the most ancient and the most powerful of creatures understand Deep Speech for it is the ancestral language of [[The Many]]. Even though they were humans and the likes, they spoke in deep speech. Deep speech doesn't have a written language but [[The Many]] created one for it comprised of runic carvings and symbols. Creations of [[The Many]], temples and buildings of [[The Many]], and their machines all respond exclusively to Deep Speech for it was the protected language of their creators.
#### Infernal
Infernal is the language of [[The Betrayer Gods]]. Their followers speak this cursed and abrupt language to communicate in their deeds of evil. It is frowned upon for someone believing in the good of the world to speak the in the tongue of the hated. However, it is common for those who fight the scourges of Mist to learn Infernal simply to allow them to understand that which they fight. 
#### Primordial:
Texts in primordial are usually dedicated to the worship of beings not of either [[The Prime Deities]] or [[The Betrayer Gods]]. Ancient ritual texts such as [[The Codex of The Storm]], the summoning texts for [[The Storm Lord]], are one of these texts. Cultists of 'higher' beings (outside [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]]) use primordial for their cults.  
#### Sylvan:
Writings in sylvan are often used exclusively by [[The Green Order]], an order of elves and forest creatures that reside within and protect [[The Twilight Woods]]. Their special texts, histories, and treatises are all written with sylvan to keep their secrecy secured. It is worth noting though, that many of [[The Green Order]] are followers of either [[The Moonweaver]], [[The Wildmother]], or [[The Arch Heart]] so there is a good mix of Sylvan as well as Celestial within [[The Green Order]]. However, all sensitive materials and documents within [[The Green Order]] are still written in Sylvan for secrecies sake. 
#### Undercommon:
Undercommon is the language of cities, be it from [[Gandoras City]] to [[Hope Town]] to [[Sonderton]]. Between trades, good dealers, merchants, and smugglers all peoples of commerce learn Undercommon for their communications. Guilds write their rules and laws in the script while illegal trades converse in secretive notes of Undercommon to avoid suspicion of the law, although often Undercommon is mingled with Sylvan to disguise it from the keen eye of a well-trained official. If you expect to make trade in a city, it is best you know Undercommon. If a trader hears you speak common instead of Undercommon, you can be best assured that the prices you pay will feel like extortion.
