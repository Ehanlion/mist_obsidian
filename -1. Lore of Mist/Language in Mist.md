# Over-arching Idea:
I as a GM have often just brushed over languages, using exotic ones whenever I saw fit but I have realized that it is far cooler and more interesting to lock certain exotic languages to certain groups. That gives an air of 'knowing' whenever you find something in one of these exotic languages because it gives the impression that it ties to some larger group.
# The Exotic Languages:
| Language | Typical Speakers | Script | **Usage in Mist** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Abyssal | Demons | Infernal |  |
| Celestial | Celestials | Celestial |  |
| Draconic | Dragons, dragonborn | Draconic |  |
| Deep Speech | Aboleths, cloakers | - | [[The Many]] |
| Infernal | Devils | Infernal |  |
| Primordial | Elementals | Dwarvish | Cults of deities outside of [[The Prime Deities]] or [[The Betrayer Gods]] |
| Sylvan | Fey creatures | Elvish | Elves and forest creatures of [[The Green Order]] |
| Undercommon | Underworld traders | Elvish |  |
In my world, these languages will gain new meanings with who and what groups are inherently tied to them.

#### Deep Speech:
Only the most ancient and the most powerful of creatures understand Deep Speech for it is the ancestral language of [[The Many]]. Even though they were humans and the likes, they spoke in deep speech. Deep speech doesn't have a written language but [[The Many]] created one for it comprised of runic carvings and symbols. 
#### Primordial:
Texts in primordial are usually dedicated to the worship of beings not of either [[The Prime Deities]] or [[The Betrayer Gods]]. Ancient ritual texts such as [[The Codex of The Storm]], the summoning texts for [[The Storm Lord]], are one of these texts. Cultists of 'higher' beings (outside [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]]) use primordial for their cults.  
#### Sylvan:
Writings in sylvan are often used exclusively by [[The Green Order]], an order of elves and forest creatures that reside within [[The Twilight Woods]]. Their special texts, histories, and treatises are all written with sylvan to keep their secrecy secured.
