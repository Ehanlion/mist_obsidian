Regional Location: [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]
Subsection: Skeletal body in [[The Umbrawood]], soul belongs to [[Garrick Blackthorn]], leader of [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] in [[The Chromatic Fangs]].

Agnedelo is an Ancient Black Dragon, and according to [[The Greatest of the Great]], [[Ignel Valis]] slayed this dragon and went down in the fight.

This is, of course, false. Ignel did defeat Agnedelo, but he bound his soul to someone that he was working with: a great warlord, now the leader of [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] who's named [[Garrick Blackthorn]]. Garrick now has the power of the ancient soul of the dragon, allowing him to perform ungodly feats that no normal black dragonborn could manage. 

Ignel was working with Garrick in an effort to restore balance to this island. However, after the Dragon was defeated and Agnedelo's soul melded with Garrick's, their alliance dissolved as Garrick left to rule [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] and bring them to glory. 
# Restoring Agnedelo:
If [[Garrick Blackthorn]] is defeated, he who defeats him will get to interact with the bound soul of [[Agnedelo the Plague-Bringer]]. The soul will play like the victim and that they are innocent and that Garrick has been using them. They will beg to be released.

The Player can choose to destroy or release the spirt. Destroying is will rend the soul, finally cause this body of Agnedelo to die. However, if the player releases the spirt, Agnedelo will rise again in all of his terrible glory. 
# True Nature:
On [[The Final Day of The Many]], when [[Faustus]] used [[The Aetherveil Projector]] to cast the mass mind blank spell to wipe everyone's memory, [[Valentino]] was battling a large group of [[The Scintillating Order]] within the deep woods. [[DeAngelo]] had used a 9th level shape change spell to become an adult black dragon. When the mind black triggered, [[DeAngelo]] lost memory of what he was and instead reverted to his current form: a cruel, evil black dragon without the empathetic mind of [[DeAngelo]] to guide it.
