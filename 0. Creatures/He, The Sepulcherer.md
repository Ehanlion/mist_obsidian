**Idea**
- An ancient creature who appears to each different, to one he might be a young boy, to another an old man, to another their most feared enemy 
	- his appearance should reflect an element of that which a creature is currently fearing
- He can answer any question he knows the answer to truthfully
- He can never lie
- He will always require his question to be answered first
	- these questions can be ruthlessly hard riddle 
	- maybe a personal question about something horrifying 
	- If you lie, he will annihilate you entirely and immediatly
		- He will suck out your soul through your eyes
		- He will drain your body of blood
		- He will crack every bone in your body

He should be encountered below ground in a dark cave
He should be hard to reach
If disrespected he should drink the mind of those who cross him

**Theme**
- dark 
- ancient
- brooding
- cruel
- Grating, metallic voice
- Non-human
