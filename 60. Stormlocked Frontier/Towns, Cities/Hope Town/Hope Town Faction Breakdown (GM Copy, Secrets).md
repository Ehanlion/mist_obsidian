GM Copy of [[Hope Town Faction Breakdown (Player Copy)]]

> [!NOTE] Faction Breakdown
> In [[Hope Town]], three primary factions dominate the city: [[The Blue Coat Brigade]], well known for their virtuous acts and honorable deeds, [[The Dead-Tide Reapers]], the general middlemen, enforcers, and neutral party in the city, and [[Fedorov's Legion]], a dark and powerful faction and the *only organization* to have *significant reach* beyond the domain of [[Hope Town]]. 
# The Blue Coat Brigade
A small party that controls the less lucrative, but still important trades in the city. Their main trade is timber-goods and without it, the organization would crumble. Generally deemed good and as lawful as a pirate is willing to be, and in return, they are seen as weak by other factions.

**Leader:** [[Pavel Hard]]
**General Faction Size:** Small
**Controlled Trades:** Medicine, Herbal Remedies, Potions, Lumber, Forestry
**City Domain:** 15% Control
**Reach in Mist:** Small connection to [[Gandoras City]], Small connection to [[The Green Order]].
- From GM notes: None to add. 
# The Dead-Tide Reapers
Middlemen of [[Hope Town]]. Generally considered neutral, but lean towards darker tendencies when push comes to shove. As generally deemed neutral party, they enforce the common law of the city with "enforcers." Do not offend. 

**Leader:** [[Tergal the Fierce]]
**General Faction Size:** Medium
**Controlled Trades:** Monstrous Sea Creatures, Exotic Animals, Stolen Artifacts, Rare Curios, The Foundry (weapon smithing, forged goods, metallurgy)
**City Domain:** 35% control
**Reach in Mist:** None known, unlikely of major connection.
- From GM notes: they really do have no outside connections
# Fedorov's Legion
A cutthroat, brutal, dark organization with a dominant hand over the more lucrative trades in [[Hope Town]]. Their leaders are successive through birthright, and uphold the required tenants of honorable marriages and blood rights from lineage to lead. Caution advised in crossing them, largest and most powerful organizations by a comically large amount. 

**Leader:** [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]
**General Faction Size:** Vast
**Controlled Trades:** Spices, Exotic Foods, Magic Items, Armor, Weapons, Gems, Jewels, Mining Equipment, Alcohol and Liquor, Slavery, Forced Labor
**City Domain:** 50% control
**Reach in Mist:** Likely major connections, dangerous, no information is known. Caution advised.

	- [[Ignel Valis]] (Silvan Gile) as advisor and council to [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]
	- [[Garrick Blackthorn]], consequence of [[Ignel Valis]] (Silvan Gile), is an old friend and adventuring buddy of [[Ignel Valis]]
	- [[The Bloodstone Pass]] and [[The Iron-fist Marauders]], consequence of knowing [[Garrick Blackthorn]] via [[Ignel Valis]]
	- [[The Syndicate of Ice]], general alliance
	- [[Baroness Von Azarov]] and [[The Black Guard]] (and the prospective order of [[The Cutthroat Authority]]), generally alliance between them and [[Fedorov's Legion]] with plans to dominate the coast.
