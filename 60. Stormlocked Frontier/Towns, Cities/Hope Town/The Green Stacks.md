### The Green Stacks:
>*The smell of dirt, fresh fruits and fragrant veggies, and fish twist in the air as you walk closer to the green stacks. You can hear bartering and chirping of merchants bickering with customers. The shouts of enforcers and the stamping of their boots are apparent as you can see flashes of weapons brandished against offenders.*

This it the central food market in the city. Yes the two main markets are separate. The Green Stacks are a multitiered collection of 'stacks,' located directly on the water front of [[The Bay of Trade]]. Farmers, who farm outside the town bring their goods to market here and fishermen who bring in large catches of generic fish sail their ships up to the docks of the market to sell. Any generic food item that you could think of could be found here. Spices and exotic resources are sold at the Great Market, not here. 

All factions have representation here since this is a communal area. As such, enforcers from each faction watch over the market together. This is one of the few places where the factions will work together. They have an understanding that, since they (in the end), are all pirates that they at least need to work together to keep the market a safe place for the trade of food.
