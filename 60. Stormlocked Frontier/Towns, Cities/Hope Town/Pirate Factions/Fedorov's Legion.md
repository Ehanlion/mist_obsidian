> *There is no laughter from the docks here. You can here the marching of men from afar. Their heavy boots smack the black stone water front as they stride. They march past massive deposits of gemstones and jewels, laid bare in the open on the docks, sorted into vibrant glowing piles. The ships here are massive, larger than anything you've seen - and pitch black. Some with too many sails to count. A massive ship lies in the harbor, dwarfing even the largest of the large ships. Its sails are black. The docks are lit by braziers, burning with a roaring passion. The massive building here are gilded in gold, and you can see colorful dresses and well dressed men parading and dancing on the upper floors. Glancing up, the upper, upper floors bristle with cannons. *
