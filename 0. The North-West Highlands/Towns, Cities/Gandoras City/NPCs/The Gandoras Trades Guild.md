# Description:
If there is trade, there will be a trade guild and within [[Gandoras City]], that guild is [[The Gandoras Trades Guild]]. Run by [[The Trades-Masters]], this guild has a propensity for profit and thin margins. Their exploits and trading have profited them immensely, making them a source of riches second only to the royal lineage of [[Gandoras City]], [[The Seat of Stone]] and the advisors to the throne of [[The Blackwood Ring]].
