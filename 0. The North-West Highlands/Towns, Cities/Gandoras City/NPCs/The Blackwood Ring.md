Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Enforcement for [[The Seat of Stone]] in [[Gandoras City]], loyal to [[King Hyranthara]].
# True Nature:
When [[The Scintillating Order]] attacked on [[The Final Day of The Many]], [[Faustus]] used [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] to cast a mass modify memory, making everyone on the island forget who they are, what they came for, and their loyalties. The Blackwood Ring is actually a derivation of [[The Scintillating Order]] and most of the members of [[The Scintillating Order]] who attacked [[The Many]] actually became members of The Blackwood Ring. They elected [[Faustus]], the person they forgot they were attacking, as their leader and designated his position [[The Seat of Stone]] marking him as the head of their group. Together, The Blackwood Ring, led by [[Faustus]] and [[The Seat of Stone]], built up the foundations of [[Gandoras City]] many thousands of years ago. 

Modern members of the original Blackwood Ring are actually descendants of [[The Scintillating Order]].

TL;DR: The Blackwood Ring are members of [[The Scintillating Order]] and were the original, close followers of their King, [[Faustus]] and [[The Seat of Stone]].
