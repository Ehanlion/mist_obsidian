Regional location: [[The North-West Highlands]] 
Subsection: None
# At First Glance:
> You crest a small knoll, the waving sea grass scratching at your knees. In the distance you can see a small town situated between two small hills -- Saddle-Port. A wisp of smoke rises from a couple chimneys in the town. It's calm. The houses have thatches sea grass roofs and are made from glimmering coral stone. You can see a couple people sitting outside on the veranda of a larger tavern and off in the distance, you see a glimmering sea-glass dome of what appears to be a library. In the background, small and colorful boat houses lie nearest to the cliff face. 

# Notable NPCs (if any):
1. [[Vivian Lovejoy]] lives here and tends the library.
2. This is [[Kelswin Lovejoy]]'s home and he also live in the library with his mother, [[Vivian Lovejoy]]. 
3. [[Jordan Leabrook]] is the town's guard and he lives here with his wife and 3 kids. 
4. Yvon and Clement are two funny, adventurous fisherman.   
# Parts of the Town:
>Saddle-Port is small -- Less than a hundred people call this small town home. On the outskirts are quant cottages, each with a trodden dirt path leading into town. In the town there is the library, the tavern, the market stalls, and a trading post. There is a small open area where events are hosted but it is small. Towards the cliff's edge are the docks; ships are set in rails on the dry docks and are hoisted to and from the sea using pulleys and cattle.

#### The Library: "The Cozy Book Nook"
This library is run by [[Vivian Lovejoy]]. It has a small adjacent cottage where [[Vivian Lovejoy]] and her adopted son [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] live. 

The library contains a lot of textbook and treatises, magical tomes on spell casting, and folk hero tales. Notably, the collection contains a first edition of [[The Greatest of the Great]], a tale about the exploits of the late, great wizard -- [[Ignel Valis]]. 

The books are all on shelves in a circular room with a colorful, stained glass dome overhead. It makes the room shift and glimmer with beautiful, colorful lights. 
#### The Tavern: "The Drunken Wyvern"
The tavern is pretty run-of-the-mill. It has a simple, well stocked bar tended by a man named Herbert Shaw. There is a small attached kitchen that serves meals of the sea, almost all being made with fish. The cook's name is Alice Shaw and she is Herbert's wife. 

The tavern has small gambling game nights, playing [[Black-wing's Duels]] and [[Dragon's Hoard Twenty-One]] on most nights. There is also a dart board, riddled with holes from its frequent use.

Nearby to the tavern are some visitors cottages that the tavern runs. There are two cottages, an expensive nicer one costing 2 gp a night, and a cheaper one made from an old outhouse costing 1 gp a night. In Herbert's spare time, he is building a new, third cottage that will be a nice middle point between the three. 

1. Herbert Shaw: Older, no hair and bald, multiple scars from when he worked on fishing boats. Likes to tell stories.
2. Alice Shaw: Older, flowing grey hair and keen eyes. Friendly laugh and enjoys talking about the specials for the day that she is cooking.

#### The Trading Post: "Yugo's Store"
Saddle-Port, like many towns, has a small trading port where merchant cargos sell small amounts of their goods to the local tender. This trading post is run by a man named Yugo Stolid.  

Carried are simple goods, two healing potions, and a potion of water breathing. He has many troves of old fishing gear. He also knows when the next caravan is due in because they run on a relatively regular schedule. 

The trading post also stocks basic food supplies from a supply caravan that runs up the coast from [[Gandoras City]]. The caravan comes just about every week and will sell basic goods to Yugo, who will then sell them to the people of saddle-port. 

1. Yugo Stolid: Young and squat halfling who is very noticing. Good at bartering to make a sale. Uses a Russian accent.
#### Oxen stables:
Saddle-port naturally has a lot of oxen grazing nearby so it is logical that they use oxen for the fishing turn-styles. Oxen also provide an excellent source of dairy, much needed for a small, isolated town.

The stables are run buy [[Burton Browns]], the ox tamer and the pens are patrolled by an irritable bull named Big Betty. 

1. [[Burton Browns]]: Fat, heavy-set, and squat. Wears a straw hat and thick overalls. 
#### The Fishery:
Much is said about the fishery later in the documents, in the "How they fish" section. As a general description, the fishery is near the oxen stables. The boat houses, being the furthest back part of the fishing area, are only about 200 feet from the cliff's edge. 
#### The Market Stalls:
Goods are sold here daily. Fishermen bringing in a catch sell their goods here to the local people. People with gardens will bring some of their produce to sell. Anything sold here is done as an augmentation to the goods that can be bought from Yugo and the Trading Post, since it stocks most of the basic necessities. 
#### Smaller parts:
1. The far look rock: a perfectly flat, 10 ft diameter rock, elevated about 30 feet above the boat houses and oxen stables, over-looking the cliff. A favored reading spot for [[Kelswin Lovejoy]]. 
# How they fish:
> Gazing towards the cliff, you see a couple large turn-styles, pens of oxen, and large spools of tarred ropes. There are multiple, colorful boat houses where you can see sailors taking items from stacked crates nearby. Fish are being brought to market from the boat houses. As you watch, oxen turn some sort of large turn-style and slowly but surely, a boat is dragged vertically up the cliff face before slamming down on some wooden rails at the top of the cliff. A smattering of applause rises from the oxen drivers and sailors on the boat. 

In Saddle-Port, boats are hauled up the tall cliff faces with a rope-pulley system and long wood rails attached to the cliff face. 

There are three wood rails attached to the cliff, two that are 10 feet wide and one that is 15 feet wide (for large ship). The wood would break quickly if it wasn't for a well at the top of the cliff that drips water mixed with a kelp mixture down each of the wood rails to lubricate them. 

To pull ships up the cliff face, Saddle-Port uses a simple combination of Oxen, turn-styles, and some large wooden cogs. Each wooden track up the cliff has a turn-style near the top of it. That turn-style is manned by four oxen. They walk around on a raised stone platform. This gives room for the cogs that are attached to the center of the turn-style to fit. Those cogs in turn connect to a massive spool that the large ropes wrap around. The rope that wraps around that spool gets dropped down the cliff face and with a hook on its end, is attached to ships wishing to be dragged up the cliff face.

Once up the cliff face, boats can slide along wooden rails on the cliff's top, although now they are simply dragged by oxen. The rails on the cliff's top have trenches dug beneath them, allowing the keels of the vessels to slide without interruption. Of course, there are three tracks leading from each of the three tracks on the cliff face. These each lead to a turn-table made from wood and stone wheels (allowing it to rotate, with the help of oxen again). The turn-table has many offshoot tracks that lead to boat houses and finally, this is where boats are stored. 
# Events
Eventually, a raid will occur on the village as described in [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. They will target [[Vivian Lovejoy]] because she is a librarian.
