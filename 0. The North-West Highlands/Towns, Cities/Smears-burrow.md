Regional location: [[The North-West Highlands]] 
Subsection: None
# At First Glance:
>Smears-Burrow is a bustling little town. Its people rush around a town square moving fish from the seas into ice-rock cellars for safe keeping. The buildings are made of a dark coral-looking stone and an abundance of strangely coloured plants grows from the stones. The town feels low, not a lot of high buildings cross your view. Many of the buildings are nestled into the sides of small knolls in the landscape, with lazy paths drifting between them.  
# Notable NPCs:
1. [[Reggie Brown]] is a well liked fishermen who went missing some days before a raid happened on the town.
2. The Grung: since Smears-burrow relies on dive-fishing, they have a large amount of Grung living in the town. They are perfectly civil of course, but it is still an oddity.
3. Buster Croaks, elder of the Grung. Green grung with various tattoos of the great fish he has caught.
4. Simon Karbala, elder of the rest. Old gentlemen of the village. Is a aging human with thick grey hair. Still enjoys fishing of course, but is getting on in his years.
5. Freya Depths-Chaser, revered of the rest. Young female Tiefling fisher-women. She once held onto a great fish and was dragged to the depths but caught the fish. Earned her the title 'Depths-Chaser.'
# Parts of the Town:

#### The Tavern: "The Laughing Elk"
This tavern is a large building -- one of the few multistory structures in Smears-burrow. The bottom floor is crafted from the same sea stone that most other buildings are made from while the top floor rests above it, made from a light wood. The roof, like many other buildings, is a sea slate. The kitchen is set into the hill the tavern is built into and small chimneys rise from this hill, wafting tantalizing smoke into the air. 

Since Smears-burrow is large, this tavern is often rowdy. It is also the only place of food in the town, making it a popular destination for every meal of the day. Inside the bottom floor is a warm eating hall with long tables and the upstairs has a bar for drinking as well as smaller tables for games.

The tavern has many cooks since it has a very high demand and multiple bartenders that all work together.
1. Bartender: Helga
2. Bartender: Belga 
3. Cook: Bjorn
4. Cook: Storga
5. Cook: Lyra 

Here are what can be found in the tavern at any given point:
1. A man offering coin for labor hauling fish to market.
2. A man asking about his friend, [[Reggie Brown]].
3. A women asking someone to dive off the coat for her lost ring.
4. Two man who want some diving partners to hunt a particularly large red fish that has been eating fish near the docks. 
5. A women who wants help cleaning off some of the buildings in the center of town. 
#### The Store: "The Dull Store"
This is the general store in Smears-burrow. Like other towns along the coast, they are supplied by a trade caravan every other week or so. This store is a simply barn-like structure with an attached stone building. It acts like a warehouse, storing necessary goods. 

Run by a man named Zurbag. He is a beefy orc. 
#### The Rarities Store: "The Shiny Store"
Unlike other towns, Smears-burrow sees a trove of oddities pulled up from the bottom of the sea. They get highly unique fishes as well as gems from their fisheries and their mines. It is possible to buy the following here:
1. unique gems of every color
2. decorative clusters of rare coral
3. Grung poison (donated by Grung to Snaglak to sell to locals since it helps to kill fish quicker.)
4. Cheaper armors and weapons. 
5. 'Descending rocks' (normal rocks that are smooth and nice)
6. Descending belts (to hold the descending rocks of course...)

Run by a man named Snaglak. He is a Grung. 
#### The Grung Ponds:
The people of Smears-burrow love the Grung that live there. Not only are they civil, but they are wonderful fishers. The grung make most of their homes nearby to the large portion of cottages where the rest of the village lives. 

Their homes consist of deep, dark green ponds with flowers and florals growing near the edges. The pools are deep, and the grung make their homes in air pockets underneath the surface of the water. 

A leader of the Grung is chosen by who catches the greatest fish the year before. As expected, this position changes a lot and is a fierce competition amongst the Grung. They have a massive chamber where they track Grung fisher's scores. They are such great fishers because of how competitive they are. 

Their current leader is named Buster Croaks. He is an elder Grung. 
#### The White Cliff Mines:
The cliffs nears Smears-burrow are rich with crystals alongside deposits of [[Ice-Rocks]]. There are permanent scaffoldings that have been built, spanning the cliffs all along the cliffs near Smears-burrow. Unlike many other towns along the coast, there are miners that make theirs homes here because of the riches found in the cliff faces. 

There are also deep and treacherous caves along the cliffside here, far above sea level. They have exposed riches in them, but there are dangerous cave-prowling creatures that will attack miners. 
# How They Fish:
> As you look towards the cliffs, you can see a walkway of slatted planks leading to the cliff face. There are piles of rope and what appear to be some large metal clips nearby. Some men appear from below, lugging massive crates full of lobsters.

Smears-burrow fishes without the use of boats. There is a visitors jetty where visiting boats can dock, but the townspeople don't fish from boats. Instead, at the base of the cliffs, they have built long floating jetties out about a hundred feet into the ocean. The waters directly off the cliff from Smears-burrow are an excellent place to farm shellfish like lobsters and crabs, as well as smaller fish.

Most 'fishermen' here are instead divers. They set out cages and traps for shellfish and then dive down beneath the jetties with breath-holds to go spear-fishing. It is far more productive.

To get down to the jetties there are long, dangerous wooden scaffolding that gets built into the sides of the cliffs. 

This means that any ship NOT docked at the decks specifically for visiting ships is an oddity and a rarity and not something to be overlooked. 

# Events:
1. The monthly fish-off. Teams of 4 accepted. Judging done by the towns elders, one from the Grung and two from the rest of the town (since that is how the percentage population divides, 33% Grung, 66% other). Categories for: largest catch, most dangerous catch, most odd catch, and prettiest fish. Gold prizes to the winners. Many come from [[Saddle-Port]], [[Herringshold]], and [[Gullhook]] to join in. 
2. The great Grung-Others capture the flag game. Every year, around when the season begin to change back from cold and frosty to warm and spring-y, a game of capture the flag is held. No maiming, but blunt trauma and knocking people out is allowed. It is just for fun. Winning team gets a trophy. The Grung have lost this for 8 years in a row now.
