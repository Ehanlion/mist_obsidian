Small fishing town up the coast from [[Saddle-Port]]. It is bigger than Saddle-Port and has a lot more business' with fishing. It also has a small business for mining the cliffs, since below the town on the cliff face, are deposits of crystals with caves that make for dangerous, but profitable mining.
