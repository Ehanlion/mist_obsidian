Small fishing town up the coast from [[Saddle-Port]]. It is bigger than Saddle-Port and has a lot more business' with fishing. It also has a small business for mining the cliffs, since below the town on the cliff face, are deposits of crystals with caves that make for dangerous, but profitable mining. 

# At First Glance:
>Smears-Burrow is a bustling little town. Its people rush around a town square moving fish from the seas into ice-rock cellars for safe keeping. The buildings are made of a dark coral-looking stone and an abundance of strangely coloured plants grows from the stones. The town feels low, not a lot of high buildings cross your view. Many of the buildings are nestled into the sides of small knolls in the landscape, with lazy paths drifting between them.  
# Notable NPCs:
1. [[Reggie Brown]] is a well liked fishermen who went missing some days before a raid happened on the town.

# How They Fish:
> As you look towards the cliffs, you can see a walkway of slatted planks leading to the cliff face. There are piles of rope and what appear to be some large metal clips nearby. Some men appear from below, lugging massive crates full of lobsters.

Smears-burrow fishes without the use of boats. There is a visitors jetty where visiting boats can dock, but the townspeople don't fish from boats. Instead, at the base of the cliffs, they have built long floating jetties out about a hundred feet into the ocean. The waters directly off the cliff from Smears-burrow are an excellent place to farm shellfish like lobsters and crabs, as well as smaller fish.

Most 'fishermen' here are instead divers. They set out cages and traps for shellfish and then dive down beneath the jetties with breath-holds to go spear-fishing. It is far more productive.

To get down to the jetties there are long, dangerous wooden scaffolding that gets built into the sides of the cliffs. 

This means that any ship NOT docked at the decks specifically for visiting ships is an oddity and a rarity and not something to be overlooked.
