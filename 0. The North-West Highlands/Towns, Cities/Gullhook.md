# Description:
Gullhook stands one of the largest towns along [[The North-West Highlands]], trailing only to [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and [[Trawlrock]]. The town is expansive, with hundreds of buildings, a bustling downtown, and some thousands of residents - far more than the hundred or so of [[Saddle-Port]]. The town is split into districts: **industry**, **commerce**, **living**, and **entertainment**. If you want something, [[Gullhook]] probably has it. 

**Read This to set the Stage:**
>Gullhook, perched atop the tall, stark white cliffs overlooking the turbulent sea, is a vibrant tapestry of life and energy in the North-West Highlands. The town pulses with activity; the sound of crashing waves mingles with the clamor of merchants hawking exotic wares in the bustling marketplace. Narrow, winding streets filled with colorful shops and lively taverns spill into open plazas, where performers and storytellers captivate audiences. The air is thick with the scents of sea salt and fresh bread, carried by the cool coastal breeze. The distant, ancient forest stands as a silent guardian, its dense canopy a stark contrast to the lively, sun-soaked town. Gullhook is divided into distinct districts, each with its own unique charm: the industrious hum of the docks, the vibrant energy of the commercial center, the cozy warmth of residential quarters, and the spirited nightlife of the entertainment district. It's a town where dreams are chased, fortunes are made, and every corner holds the promise of adventure. Whether you're seeking rare treasures, a hearty meal, or a night of revelry, Gullhook has a place for everyone, weaving together the stories of its residents and visitors into a rich, ever-evolving tapestry.
# Destruction in Gullhook:
Thanks to [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], and a vicious raid (now about 3 weeks ago), some parts of Gullhook are in disarray:
- Walls surrounding edges of town, closest to [[The High Forests]] are destroyed and burned.
- Many houses are destroyed around edges. 
- Crab corpses littered in groups of 10 ish at various spots, flowers now grow from them
	- These are concentrated from the cliff face and towards the entertainment district, specifically Starlight Archives and Rock Bottom.
- Remnants of battles around western edge of town and around entertainment sector.

**Specific, extra amenities for each:**
Each location has its own tiny restaurants and shops because of their size. The primary districts have larger establishments but small, hole-in-the-wall places are present for each residential area.

##### Special Development for Temple Glade:
The following actually works really closely with [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] and abducts people from town and sends them over to the slave house. They have been targeting grieving people from the recent raids. They bring them into private rooms to pray, drug them, and then cart them over. They are working closely with [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]] who are helping with this.

# How they Fish:
> Large rune-rocks dot the coast here. They swirl with vibrant magical energy as mages, rock-tenders they are called, stand to invoke them on wooden scaffolding. A coordinator stands by the cliff on a raised wooden platform issuing signals to the rock-tenders. Ships float up the cliff, wrapped in an arcane embrace as the mages set them down upon wooden berthing docks, arranged in neat rows near the cliff. Cargo and fishing catches levitate out of hulls and nets and are set down in neat sorting piles nearby. 
### The Magic Rune Rocks:
Huge, towering magic rocks with scaffolding built on the sides of them channel magical runes throughout the air near ish to the cliffs. Rock-tenders control the rocks through rhythmic dances, song, chanting, and hand movements. Some rocks stand right on the cliffs and others stand further in from the cliff. Ships get passed from rock to rock by the rock-tenders to move them around. 

They give off signatures of **conjuration** and **transmutation**. 

**Abilities:**
When invoked, they make heavy objects very light and can levitate them. Rock-tenders are able to invoke the rocks through their ways to lift ships up the cliffs and then hand them to other rock-tenders further inland to set down. 

*The rocks of Many?*
They are actually a small project of [[The Many]], mostly a gag idea but expanded on later to help quarry places which eventually created the sea caves of [[Shimmer Mist Lagoon]], [[The Echoing Grotto]], and [[The Sunken Caverns]].
