# Description:
Gullhook stands one of the largest towns along [[The North-West Highlands]], trailing only to [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and [[Trawlrock]]. The town is expansive, with hundreds of buildings, a bustling downtown, and some thousands of residents - far more than the hundred or so of [[Saddle-Port]]. The town is split into districts: **industry**, **commerce**, **living**, and **entertainment**. If you want something, [[Gullhook]] probably has it. 

**Read This to set the Stage:**
>Gullhook, perched atop the tall, stark white cliffs overlooking the turbulent sea, is a vibrant tapestry of life and energy in the North-West Highlands. The town pulses with activity; the sound of crashing waves mingles with the clamor of merchants hawking exotic wares in the bustling marketplace. Narrow, winding streets filled with colorful shops and lively taverns spill into open plazas, where performers and storytellers captivate audiences. The air is thick with the scents of sea salt and fresh bread, carried by the cool coastal breeze. The distant, ancient forest stands as a silent guardian, its dense canopy a stark contrast to the lively, sun-soaked town. Gullhook is divided into distinct districts, each with its own unique charm: the industrious hum of the docks, the vibrant energy of the commercial center, the cozy warmth of residential quarters, and the spirited nightlife of the entertainment district. It's a town where dreams are chased, fortunes are made, and every corner holds the promise of adventure. Whether you're seeking rare treasures, a hearty meal, or a night of revelry, Gullhook has a place for everyone, weaving together the stories of its residents and visitors into a rich, ever-evolving tapestry.
# Destruction in Gullhook:
Thanks to [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], and a vicious raid (now about 3 weeks ago), some parts of Gullhook are in disarray:
- Walls surrounding edges of town, closest to [[The High Forests]] are destroyed and burned.
- Many houses are destroyed around edges. 
- Crab corpses littered in groups of 10 ish at various spots, flowers now grow from them
	- These are concentrated from the cliff face and towards the entertainment district, specifically Starlight Archives and Rock Bottom.
- Remnants of battles around western edge of town and around entertainment sector. 
# TOWN EFFECTS READ HERE:
### Price Crunch ACTIVE:
Due to the intense raids across [[The North-West Highlands]], [[Gandoras City]] stopping the caravans and trade convoys from legally leaving the city, and increased raids on town-to-town trade by northern bandits, it has been difficult to get more expensive items between cities. So not only are *prices* *increased*, but *supply is reduced heavily.* Every merchant will complain about the rarity of incoming trades of actually valuable goods. 
### Town Raids:
Sahuaguin are still present both within the town and within [[The High Forests]]. They are conducting small raids, to steal supplies, gold, items, and people if they can. They coordinate secretly with [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]], alongside visitors from [[Hope Town]]: [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]]. They hideout in the salvage yards and like to operate at night, disguised. With high enough observation skills you can notice them in taverns or in back alleys watching the townsfolk. 
### Raids on the Byway:
Sahuaguin may be messing with the town, but another force is at large, [[The Forest Freaks]]. A group of rowdy children, teens, and early-stage 20-year-olds lead a group that raid convoys between [[Gullhook]] and [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and then [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and [[Trawlrock]]. None know the true nature of this group, so they are described by those who have witnessed them as "masked forest creatures, who appear from thin air, hit the convoys, and vanish like a disappearing mist on a sunny day." They are known to use non-lethal methods and to target valuables in transit, like magic items and treasury shipments. Refer to [[The Forest Freaks]] document for info on how to find them, their hideout, and their reasons behind attacks. 

# Parts of Town:
[[Gullhook]] is divided into 4 primary sections: Industry, Entertainment, Living, and Commerce. Alongside each other live creatures of every walk of life. Small in portions compared to the great city of [[Gandoras City]] but large next to any of the towns upon [[The North-West Highlands]].

#### Rock Bottom:
>A beat down looking bar, once made from heavy slabs of dark stone. Now it sits desolate and disused, the stone blocks crumbles to rubble. Lichen grows all over as the roof is fractured and destroyed.
#### Chugga's:
>A rowdy tavern where bad ale and even worse liquor flows freely for long and till late. Rough crowds, don't bring your money, you'll lose it.
#### The Sorcerer's Parlor:
>A magical tavern with magical evenings. Gravity doesn't work in here so tables float, meals fly, the servers have wings. It's all upside down thanks to Quicks.
#### Love Makes its Way:
>A stylish brothel house with fine dining, finer partners, and swanky prices. Not for the average joe but a splurge of cash will get you far here. Just don't cross Alan, he'll kill you.
#### Starlight Archives:
>A once beautiful white building with elegant stained glass windows is now a half burnt shell, the fantastic windows shattered and destroyed. The building closed the the public.
#### The Temple Glade:
>In the midst of the town, slightly away from the rest of the buildings likes a grove of trees and bushes. In the midst sits a small clustering of religious buildings: stone heat domes, long preaching halls, and small shrines.

**Special Development for Temple Glade:**
The following actually works really closely with [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] and abducts people from town and sends them over to the slave house. They have been targeting grieving people from the recent raids. They bring them into private rooms to pray, drug them, and then cart them over. They are working closely with [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]] who are helping with this. 
# How they Fish:
> Large rune-rocks dot the coast here. They swirl with vibrant magical energy as mages, rock-tenders they are called, stand to invoke them on wooden scaffolding. A coordinator stands by the cliff on a raised wooden platform issuing signals to the rock-tenders. Ships float up the cliff, wrapped in an arcane embrace as the mages set them down upon wooden berthing docks, arranged in neat rows near the cliff. Cargo and fishing catches levitate out of hulls and nets and are set down in neat sorting piles nearby. 
### The Magic Rune Rocks:
Huge, towering magic rocks with scaffolding built on the sides of them channel magical runes throughout the air near ish to the cliffs. Rock-tenders control the rocks through rhythmic dances, song, chanting, and hand movements. Some rocks stand right on the cliffs and others stand further in from the cliff. Ships get passed from rock to rock by the rock-tenders to move them around. 

They give off signatures of **conjuration** and **transmutation**. 

**Abilities:**
When invoked, they make heavy objects very light and can levitate them. Rock-tenders are able to invoke the rocks through their ways to lift ships up the cliffs and then hand them to other rock-tenders further inland to set down. 

*The rocks of Many?*
They are actually a small project of [[The Many]], mostly a gag idea but expanded on later to help quarry places which eventually created the sea caves of [[Shimmer Mist Lagoon]], [[The Echoing Grotto]], and [[The Sunken Caverns]].
