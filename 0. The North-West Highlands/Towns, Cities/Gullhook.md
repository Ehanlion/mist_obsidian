# Description:
Gullhook stands one of the largest towns along [[The North-West Highlands]], trailing only to [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and [[Trawlrock]]. The town is expansive, with hundreds of buildings, a bustling downtown, and some thousands of residents - far more than the hundred or so of [[Saddle-Port]]. The town is split into districts: **industry**, **commerce**, **living**, and **entertainment**. If you want something, [[Gullhook]] probably has it.

### Entertainment
# How they Fish:
> Large rune-rocks dot the coast here. They swirl with vibrant magical energy as mages, rock-tenders they are called, stand to invoke them on wooden scaffolding. A coordinator stands by the cliff on a raised wooden platform issuing signals to the rock-tenders. Ships float up the cliff, wrapped in an arcane embrace as the mages set them down upon wooden berthing docks, arranged in neat rows near the cliff. Cargo and fishing catches levitate out of hulls and nets and are set down in neat sorting piles nearby.
