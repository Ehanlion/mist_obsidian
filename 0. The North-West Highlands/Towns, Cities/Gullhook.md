# Description:
Gullhook stands one of the largest towns along [[The North-West Highlands]], trailing only to [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and [[Trawlrock]]. The town is expansive, with hundreds of buildings, a bustling downtown, and some thousands of residents - far more than the hundred or so of [[Saddle-Port]]. The town is split into districts: **industry**, **commerce**, **living**, and **entertainment**. If you want something, [[Gullhook]] probably has it. 

> [!NOTE] **Read to set the Stage:**
> Gullhook, perched atop the tall, stark white cliffs overlooking the turbulent sea, is a vibrant tapestry of life and energy in the North-West Highlands. The town pulses with activity; the sound of crashing waves mingles with the clamor of merchants hawking exotic wares in the bustling marketplace. Narrow, winding streets filled with colorful shops and lively taverns spill into open plazas, where performers and storytellers captivate audiences. The air is thick with the scents of sea salt and fresh bread, carried by the cool coastal breeze. The distant, ancient forest stands as a silent guardian, its dense canopy a stark contrast to the lively, sun-soaked town. Gullhook is divided into distinct districts, each with its own unique charm: the industrious hum of the docks, the vibrant energy of the commercial center, the cozy warmth of residential quarters, and the spirited nightlife of the entertainment district. It's a town where dreams are chased, fortunes are made, and every corner holds the promise of adventure. Whether you're seeking rare treasures, a hearty meal, or a night of revelry, Gullhook has a place for everyone, weaving together the stories of its residents and visitors into a rich, ever-evolving tapestry.
# Destruction in Gullhook:
Thanks to [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], and a vicious raid (now about 3 weeks ago), some parts of Gullhook are in disarray:
- Walls surrounding edges of town, closest to [[The High Forests]] are destroyed and burned.
- Many houses are destroyed around edges. 
- Crab corpses littered in groups of 10 ish at various spots, flowers now grow from them
	- These are concentrated from the cliff face and towards the entertainment district, specifically Starlight Archives and Rock Bottom.
- Remnants of battles around western edge of town and around entertainment sector. 
## Specifying the Destruction Further:
> [!NOTE] Describing the Destruction
> Looking around the town, you notice upon closer investigation, that it is rife with damage and carnage. The dirge quarters, standing on the outskirts of the town were assaulted and the remnants of burned husks of buildings are still clearly noticeably, despite the efforts to clean the area and to plant new flowers and bushes amidst the wreckage. Furthermore, the Entertainment district suffered heavy assaults,. The beautiful compound of the starlight archives library and the rugged and municipal stone walls of the Rock Bottom Tavern have been destroyed and annihilated, the corpses of several massive crabs now teeming with planted flowers and creeping vines. Damages to the sea-side section of the industry district, specifically the Dry Docks and the Cradles are minimal but present; numerous massive crab husks are surrounded by traditional grave stones of those who fought to protect the diverse and colorful fleet of ships stocked here. 
# Town-Wide Effects:
## Prices are Higher than Ever:
Due to the intense raids across [[The North-West Highlands]], [[Gandoras City]] stopping the caravans and trade convoys from legally leaving the city, and increased raids on town-to-town trade by northern bandits, it has been difficult to get more expensive items between cities. So not only are *prices* *increased*, but *supply is reduced heavily.* Every merchant will complain about the rarity of incoming trades of actually valuable goods. 
## Small Sahuaguin Town Raids:
Sahuaguin are still present both within the town and within [[The High Forests]]. They are conducting small raids, to steal supplies, gold, items, and people if they can. They coordinate secretly with [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]], alongside visitors from [[Hope Town]]: [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]]. They hideout in the salvage yards and like to operate at night, disguised. With high enough observation skills you can notice them in taverns or in back alleys watching the townsfolk. 
## Non-Sahuaguin Raids on Byway:
Sahuaguin may be messing with the town, but another force is at large, [[The Forest Freaks]]. A group of rowdy children, teens, and early-stage 20-year-olds lead a group that raid convoys between [[Gullhook]] and [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and then [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and [[Trawlrock]]. None know the true nature of this group, so they are described by those who have witnessed them as "masked forest creatures, who appear from thin air, hit the convoys, and vanish like a disappearing mist on a sunny day." They are known to use non-lethal methods and to target valuables in transit, like magic items and treasury shipments. Refer to [[The Forest Freaks]] document for info on how to find them, their hideout, and their reasons behind attacks. 
## Security Crackdown and Harsh Guards:
The guards are friendly to the townsfolk, but make no mistake, they will imprison and execute anyone who is acting in a nature that deserves punishment. Theft of goods less than 1000 gp results in imprisonment of over a year. Theft of goods exceeding 1000 gp is punishable by death. Attacking someone results in being locked in stockades. Causing bleeding results in imprisonment. Using a deadly weapon also immediately results in imprisonment. Killing someone means you get killed. 
# Parts of Town:
[[Gullhook]] is divided into 4 primary sections: Industry, Entertainment, Living, and Commerce. Alongside each other live creatures of every walk of life. Small in portions compared to the great city of [[Gandoras City]] but large next to any of the towns upon [[The North-West Highlands]].

2. [[The Fruity Orchards]]: sells any type of fruit. They have massive orchards. Are currently bringing in low amount of fruit. Something is eating their workers and their fruit. Fruit dragon maybe???
3. [[Bonnie's Hovel Farms]]: Small monk-style huts that farm simple earth-bound crops like potatoes, onions, carrots, basically any root veggies. They are also badass monks that can train you. 
4. [[The Great Middle Growers]]: They grow everything, yes I mean everything in vast amounts. By far the largest far, so largest vendor representation.

### The Dirge Quarters:

Despite the hardships, there's a strong sense of community, and the area is often filled with the sound of music and laughter as neighbors come together to support one another.
### The Hovels:

### The Scuttled Holds:

The facility is a fortress-like complex, designed for both defense and training, with high walls and well-guarded gates. Inside, the barracks are functional and orderly, equipped with all necessary amenities to support the town's defenders. The atmosphere is disciplined and focused, with regular drills and a strong emphasis on readiness and duty.

### Rock Bottom:
>A beat down looking bar, once made from heavy slabs of dark stone. Now it sits desolate and disused, the stone blocks crumbles to rubble. Lichen grows all over as the roof is fractured and destroyed.

**Abandoned:**
Prior to the raid on the town, this was a bustling point of drinking for your average working townsperson. It was simple, municipal, but lively at night. It had fair, generous prices and hearty food. Many came here for simple nights with good memories. However now, the building is closed being half destroyed from the raid. On the premises sit numerous shells of giant crabs, tantamount to the viciousness of the raid. 
### Chugga's:
>Chugga's is a notorious, rowdy tavern where bad ale and even worse liquor flow freely from dawn till the wee hours. The dimly lit interior is a chaotic blend of laughter, shouting, and the occasional brawl, making it a magnet for sailors, adventurers, and anyone looking to forget their troubles. The rough wooden tables and chairs bear the scars of countless drunken nights, and the air is thick with the smell of spilled beer and pipe smoke.
>
>The tavern's infamous tournaments of [[Ball Knockers]] — A relatively sophisticated game of billiards combined with gambling — and Chug contests, where participants race to down tankards of the foulest brews, are the stuff of legend. These events draw a crowd of spectators and competitors eager to prove their mettle and perhaps win a few coins, though most leave lighter in the pocket and heavier in the head.
>
>Gambling is rampant at Chugga's, with dice games, card tables, and impromptu bets springing up in every corner. The raucous atmosphere is overseen by the burly and ever-watchful owner, Chugga, whose booming voice can silence even the rowdiest of patrons. His presence ensures that, while chaos reigns, things never get completely out of hand.
>
>The walls of Chugga's are adorned with a mismatched collection of maritime relics, hunting trophies, and dubious "art," each with its own tale of misadventure. Despite the rough crowd and questionable beverages, there's a certain camaraderie and thrill that keeps patrons coming back, night after wild night.

**Interesting Patrons:**
- Chugga the tavern keep keeps a watchful eye over the room
	- Chugga is a HUGE orc, built like an 800 pound cube with a massive apron that says Chugga Chugs 
	- Chugga is strong, high con, charismatic, and wise. His dex and int blow 
- [[Glorval]] and [[Glee Bishop]], [[Ball Knockers]] duo of doom, play the  ball knockers tables
#### Drinks at Chugga's:
- The Big Chug = massive barrel of ale. If you order you *must* chug it in 30 seconds or you will get thrown out to incredibly loud applause.
- Normal Ale
- Vintage Fire Wine = burns intensely and dulls your perception but increases you strength 
- The Seducer Shot = turns you into a love machine, advantage on charisma checks and saves
- **Drinks from the Breweries of Brine**:
	- *Sea Salt Beer* = salty after taste, cheap. Burps taste like the ocean
	- *Aged Seaweed Wine* = expensive, complex taste, allows user to speak to sea creatures very briefly if it is used to get someone VERY drunk. 
	- *Coral-Cask aged Whiskey of the Sea* = imbued with strength of coral. If used to get someone VERY drunk, they have resistance to slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage but have disadvantage on saves, ability checks, and attack roles since they are VERY disoriented. 
	- *Jelly-Venom Infused Mead* = deliciously sweet and deliciously deadly, a mead made from the venom of a deadly jellyfish named [[Yellow Cap Killers]]. When drunk, the brew can give either resistance or immunity to poison damage depending on how much is consumed. To get resistance, consume a small amount and pass a DC 13 Con save. To get immunity, pass a DC 18 Con save. On a failure, resistance-consumption gives the poisoned condition for 24 hours until cured. For immunity-consumption, the potion gives a madness as well as the poisoned condition for 24 hours.

### The Sorcerer's Parlor:
>A magical tavern with magical evenings. Gravity doesn't work in here so tables float, meals fly, the servers have wings. It's all upside down thanks to Quicks.
#### Things to do in the Parlor:
- The parlor is upper class ish, and pretty fancy.
- It is also very high magic with tall vaulted ceilings wreathed with swirling magical tides.
- A big event is the antigravity dance in which couples fly through the air to music played by a floating band. 
### Love Makes its Way:
>A stylish brothel house with fine dining, finer partners, and swanky prices. Not for the average joe but a splurge of cash will get you far here. Just don't cross Alan, he'll kill you.

#### Hookers have info:
Since hooker or workers get to see some pretty diverse clients, they have access to a lot of information. They will divulge it for a fee of course. Or a favor depending on the worker. 
### Starlight Archives:
>A once beautiful white building with elegant stained glass windows is now a half burnt shell, the fantastic windows shattered and destroyed. The building closed the the public.
### The Temple Glade:
>In the midst of the town, slightly away from the rest of the buildings likes a grove of trees and bushes. In the midst sits a small clustering of religious buildings: stone heat domes, long preaching halls, and small shrines.

The entire area is surrounded by water, kind of like a ring that you cross via a bridge. There are decadent trees lazily gracing the waters and guards and holy members standing on each of the bridges. There are three bridges, North, East, and West, and no South bridge because it is said that to go South is to go backwards in your life. 
#### Holy Grounds:
No matter what strife comes between citizens of [[Gullhook]], there is a sacred rule at the Temple Glade: No violence on the presences what so ever. There are guards that affiliate with the Temple Glade and they strictly prohibit violence and will imprison anyone that starts a fight. 
#### A Place of Healing:
There are shine to all [[The Prime Deities]] here as well as shrine to some of [[The Betrayer Gods]], (namely [[The Spider Queen]] and [[The Whispered One]], the patrons of The Charmed Royalties and The Widow-maker's Stands from [[The High Forests]]). In the glen are weak healing shrines, many meditation rooms, heating chambers, steam saunas, and stuff like that. 

**Tennyson is violent:**\
[[Tennyson Heralds]] is violent and abducts and drugs people. Despite his good notoriety in the town and his *generous* contributions to the town guard, he would still be subject to the same laws of the town as anyone else. 
#### Tennyson and the Followers of Alsolace
The workers of temple glade actually are [[The Followers of Alsolace]], led by [[Tennyson Heralds]]. He is a mad preacher who "hails from the hidden forests ([[The High Forests]] and also total BS)." He uses smooth words, reassurance, and firm preaching to rally those who surround him.

**Special Development for Temple Glade:**
The following actually works really closely with [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] and abducts people from town and sends them over to the slave house. They have been targeting grieving people from the recent raids. They bring them into private rooms to pray, drug them, and then cart them over. They are working closely with [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]] who are helping with this. 
# How they Fish:
> Large rune-rocks dot the coast here. They swirl with vibrant magical energy as mages, rock-tenders they are called, stand to invoke them on wooden scaffolding. A coordinator stands by the cliff on a raised wooden platform issuing signals to the rock-tenders. Ships float up the cliff, wrapped in an arcane embrace as the mages set them down upon wooden berthing docks, arranged in neat rows near the cliff. Cargo and fishing catches levitate out of hulls and nets and are set down in neat sorting piles nearby. 
## The Magic Rune Rocks:
Huge, towering magic rocks with scaffolding built on the sides of them channel magical runes throughout the air near ish to the cliffs. Rock-tenders control the rocks through rhythmic dances, song, chanting, and hand movements. Some rocks stand right on the cliffs and others stand further in from the cliff. Ships get passed from rock to rock by the rock-tenders to move them around. 

They give off signatures of **conjuration** and **transmutation**. 
### Rune Rock Abilities
When invoked, they make heavy objects very light and can levitate them. Rock-tenders are able to invoke the rocks through their ways to lift ships up the cliffs and then hand them to other rock-tenders further inland to set down. 

They can also be used to levitate moving creature, so the town guard uses them in emergency to detain criminals if they are in the area. 

### SECRET: The Rocks of the Many?
They are actually a small project of [[The Many]], mostly a gag idea but expanded on later to help quarry places which eventually created the sea caves of [[Shimmer Mist Lagoon]], [[The Echoing Grotto]], and [[The Sunken Caverns]]. 
# Special Interactive Events:
These are events that are not listed as bad effects, like at the beginning of the document.
