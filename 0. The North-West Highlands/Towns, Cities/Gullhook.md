# Town Description
Gullhook stands one of the largest towns along [[The North-West Highlands]], trailing only to [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and [[Trawlrock]]. The town is expansive, with hundreds of buildings, a bustling downtown, and some thousands of residents - far more than the hundred or so of [[Saddle-Port]]. The town is split into districts: **industry**, **commerce**, **living**, and **entertainment**. If you want something, [[Gullhook]] probably has it. 

> [!NOTE] Read to set the Stage:
> Gullhook, perched atop the tall, stark white cliffs overlooking the turbulent sea, is a vibrant tapestry of life and energy in the North-West Highlands. The town pulses with activity; the sound of crashing waves mingles with the clamor of merchants hawking exotic wares in the bustling marketplace. Narrow, winding streets filled with colorful shops and lively taverns spill into open plazas, where performers and storytellers captivate audiences. The air is thick with the scents of sea salt and fresh bread, carried by the cool coastal breeze. The distant, ancient forest stands as a silent guardian, its dense canopy a stark contrast to the lively, sun-soaked town. Gullhook is divided into distinct districts, each with its own unique charm: the industrious hum of the docks, the vibrant energy of the commercial center, the cozy warmth of residential quarters, and the spirited nightlife of the entertainment district. It's a town where dreams are chased, fortunes are made, and every corner holds the promise of adventure. Whether you're seeking rare treasures, a hearty meal, or a night of revelry, Gullhook has a place for everyone, weaving together the stories of its residents and visitors into a rich, ever-evolving tapestry.
# Destruction in Gullhook:
Thanks to [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], and a vicious raid (now about 3 weeks ago), some parts of Gullhook are in disarray:
- Walls surrounding edges of town, closest to [[The High Forests]] are destroyed and burned.
- Many houses are destroyed around edges. 
- Crab corpses littered in groups of 10 ish at various spots, flowers now grow from them
	- These are concentrated from the cliff face and towards the entertainment district, specifically Starlight Archives and Rock Bottom.
- Remnants of battles around western edge of town and around entertainment sector. 
## Specifying the Destruction Further:
> [!NOTE] Describing the Destruction
> Looking around the town, you notice upon closer investigation, that it is rife with damage and carnage. The dirge quarters, standing on the outskirts of the town were assaulted and the remnants of burned husks of buildings are still clearly noticeably, despite the efforts to clean the area and to plant new flowers and bushes amidst the wreckage. Furthermore, the Entertainment district suffered heavy assaults. The beautiful compound of the starlight archives library and the rugged and municipal stone walls of the Rock Bottom Tavern have been destroyed and annihilated, the corpses of several massive crabs now teeming with planted flowers and creeping vines. Damages to the sea-side section of the industry district, specifically the Dry Docks and the Cradles are minimal but present; numerous massive crab husks are surrounded by traditional grave stones of those who fought to protect the diverse and colorful fleet of ships stocked here. 
# Town-Wide Effects:
## Prices are Higher than Ever:
Due to the intense raids across [[The North-West Highlands]], [[Gandoras City]] stopping the caravans and trade convoys from legally leaving the city, and increased raids on town-to-town trade by northern bandits, it has been difficult to get more expensive items between cities. So not only are *prices* *increased*, but *supply is reduced heavily.* Every merchant will complain about the rarity of incoming trades of actually valuable goods. 
## Small Sahuaguin Town Raids:
Sahuaguin are still present both within the town and within [[The High Forests]]. They are conducting small raids, to steal supplies, gold, items, and people if they can. They coordinate secretly with [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]], alongside visitors from [[Hope Town]]: [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]]. They hideout in the salvage yards and like to operate at night, disguised. With high enough observation skills you can notice them in taverns or in back alleys watching the townsfolk. 
## Non-Sahuaguin Raids on Byway:
Sahuaguin may be messing with the town, but another force is at large, [[The Forest Freaks]]. A group of rowdy children, teens, and early-stage 20-year-olds lead a group that raid convoys between [[Gullhook]] and [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and then [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and [[Trawlrock]]. None know the true nature of this group, so they are described by those who have witnessed them as "masked forest creatures, who appear from thin air, hit the convoys, and vanish like a disappearing mist on a sunny day." They are known to use non-lethal methods and to target valuables in transit, like magic items and treasury shipments. Refer to [[The Forest Freaks]] document for info on how to find them, their hideout, and their reasons behind attacks. 
## Security Crackdown and Harsh Guards:
The guards are friendly to the townsfolk, but make no mistake, they will imprison and execute anyone who is acting in a nature that deserves punishment. Theft of goods less than 1000 gp results in imprisonment of over a year. Theft of goods exceeding 1000 gp is punishable by death. Attacking someone results in being locked in stockades. Causing bleeding results in imprisonment. Using a deadly weapon also immediately results in imprisonment. Killing someone means you get killed. 
# Parts of Town:
[[Gullhook]] is divided into 4 primary sections: Industry, Entertainment, Living, and Commerce. Alongside each other live creatures of every walk of life. Small in portions compared to the great city of [[Gandoras City]] but large next to any of the towns upon [[The North-West Highlands]].

### The Salvage Yards:

> [!NOTE] Salvage Yard's Description
> The Salvage Yards are a chaotic sprawl of twisted metal, rotting wood, and forgotten treasures, stretching as far as the eye can see. This labyrinth of shipwrecks and lost cargo is a dangerous place where the detritus of the sea meets the ingenuity of scavengers. Towering piles of rusted chains, broken masts, and waterlogged crates create narrow pathways that wind through the wreckage, while makeshift cranes and ancient, creaking contraptions groan under the weight of their burdens. Treasure hunters and inventors pick through the debris, searching for valuable artifacts and rare materials amidst the clutter.
>
But danger lurks in every shadow. The yards are infested with creatures drawn to the remnants of old magic and the stench of decay. Lurking in the darkness are things that should not be, their eyes gleaming with hunger. The very ground beneath your feet is treacherous, with hidden pitfalls and unstable piles of wreckage threatening to collapse at the slightest provocation. Yet, within this chaotic and perilous landscape, there is potential—old traps that can be triggered, forgotten contraptions that can be reactivated, and treasures that, if found, could turn the tide of any battle. The Salvage Yards are a place where both opportunity and danger lie in wait, and only the quick-witted and brave will emerge unscathed.
#### Salvage Yard Descriptions and Features
##### Large Yard Features
Here’s a list of small places and elements to highlight in the Salvage Yards:

- **The Rusted Crane**: A towering, ancient crane, barely operational, with a massive hook that swings unpredictably in the wind. The gears grind loudly, and it creaks ominously as it shifts under its own weight. A well-timed push could send its hook crashing into an enemy or bring down a pile of debris.
- **The Cargo Graveyard**: A section of the yards filled with old, rotting crates and barrels, some of which contain valuable but unstable alchemical substances. A stray spark could set off a chain reaction of explosions, creating chaos and destruction.
- **The Scrap Piles**: Heaps of twisted metal and broken wood, stacked haphazardly and ready to collapse. Moving through these piles is risky, as they could fall and trap anyone underneath, but they also provide cover or a means to ambush unsuspecting foes.
- **The Old Ship’s Belly**: The partially intact hull of a massive ship, its interior a dark, damp maze of corridors and rooms. Within, old treasures and dangerous creatures await, with the potential to set traps or spring surprises on enemies.
- **The Mechanic’s Alcove**: A small, hidden workshop nestled within the wreckage, where an old inventor once tinkered with strange contraptions. Many of these devices still function, though they are unpredictable and could be turned into makeshift weapons or distractions.
- **The Kraken’s Bones**: The skeletal remains of a massive sea creature, draped across a section of the yard. The bones are sharp and jagged, and the area is eerily quiet, as if the creature’s spirit still lingers. Moving through here could provoke the restless undead or offer a place to set a deadly ambush.
- **The Deep Pit**: A large, open pit filled with the remains of countless ships, with jagged debris jutting out at odd angles. Falling into the pit would be dangerous, but it could also be used to lure enemies to their doom.
- **The Enchanted Anchor**: A massive, barnacle-encrusted anchor that pulses faintly with residual magic. Touching it could have unpredictable effects—summoning a ghostly crew, activating a powerful spell, or releasing a dangerous entity.
- **The Hidden Cache**: A secret stash of old weapons and gear, buried deep within a pile of rubble. Finding it could provide a significant advantage in combat, but it’s well-hidden and difficult to access without disturbing the surrounding debris.
- **The Cursed Figurehead**: The carved figurehead of a long-lost ship, rumored to be cursed. It radiates a malevolent energy that can drive creatures to madness or cause hallucinations, making it a dangerous yet potentially useful tool if controlled. If communicated with, it can even turn into a Wyvern, friendly to the creature that released it. 
- **Wrecked Maw**: The central, deepest, and most treacherous part of the yards. It is a pit filled with old ships piled on top of each other that goes down quite far. It is perilously and chaotic with pit aberrations and wraiths haunting the depths. 

These elements can add depth and dynamism to the combat, providing opportunities for creativity and strategy as players interact with the chaotic and dangerous environment of the Salvage Yards.
##### General Yard Hazards and Environment 
Here’s a list of general environmental elements to quickly refer to when describing the Salvage Yards as a group navigates through:

1. **Mounds of Frayed Ropes**: Massive piles of thick, sea-soaked ropes, now frayed and tangled. They twist like serpents on the ground, creating treacherous paths where a misstep could lead to a nasty fall.
2. **Barnacle-Crusted Hulls**: The skeletal remains of old ships, their hulls encrusted with barnacles and seaweed, jutting out at odd angles like the ribs of some long-dead leviathan. *Barnacle Beast?*
3. **Broken Masts**: Tall, splintered masts lie scattered across the yards, some still adorned with tattered, salt-stained sails that flutter weakly in the breeze.
4. **Pools of Stagnant Water**: Large, brackish pools of stagnant water collected in the lower parts of the yard, their surfaces thick with algae and the occasional ripple hinting at something lurking beneath. *Algae Beast?*
5. **Piles of Rusted Chains**: Massive, rusted chains coiled in large heaps, their links corroded and brittle, but still heavy and potentially dangerous if disturbed. *Rust Chain Golem?*
6. **Crates of Rotting Goods**: Stacks of old crates filled with the remains of long-spoiled cargo. The wood is dark and soft, and the stench of rot hangs heavily in the air.
7. **Slick, Moss-Covered Rocks**: Large rocks, slick with moss and seawater, making footing treacherous as they’re scattered among the debris.
8. **Wrecked Rowboats**: Small rowboats overturned and smashed, their wooden frames broken and splintered. Some are half-buried under the weight of larger debris.
9. **Foul-Smelling Driftwood**: Gnarled pieces of driftwood scattered about, some charred as if burned, others stained dark with the remnants of old sea battles.
10. **Collapsed Casks**: Shattered casks, their contents long spilled, creating slick, slippery areas on the ground. The lingering scent of fermented ale or brine still clings to the air around them.
11. **Tangled Nets**: Old fishing nets tangled and torn, draped over piles of debris or hanging from broken masts. They sway eerily in the wind, catching on anything that brushes against them.
12. **Corroded Anchors**: Large, corroded anchors half-buried in the muck, their flukes sharp and jagged, ready to trip up the unwary. *Anchor Lobster?*
13. **Beached Buoys**: Weather-beaten buoys scattered across the yards, their paint faded and bells long silenced. Some are cracked open, revealing the rusting innards within.
14. **Scattered Bones**: The bleached, broken bones of sea creatures—some small and some disturbingly large—litter the ground, half-hidden by the wreckage.
15. **Rusted Gears and Cogs**: Discarded pieces of old machinery, rusted and half-buried in the dirt, hinting at the mechanical wonders that once powered great ships.
16. **Worn, Faded Flags**: Tattered flags from long-forgotten ships, their colors faded and edges frayed, hang limply from makeshift poles or lie crumpled on the ground.
17. **Creaking Planks**: Loose wooden planks underfoot that creak ominously with every step, threatening to give way and send an unsuspecting explorer tumbling into the darkness below.
18. **Seaweed-Covered Debris**: Thick tendrils of seaweed draped over broken beams and crates, still damp and slick, clinging to anything it touches. *Swarm of Annoying things?*
19. **Old, Broken Lanterns**: Rusty, oil-less lanterns hang from bent posts or lie smashed on the ground, their glass panes shattered, and frames bent out of shape.
20. **Wind-Worn Figureheads**: The figureheads of old ships, worn smooth by wind and time, stand eerily in the yards—some with faces still recognizable, others eroded into ghostly shapes.

These descriptions can be used to create a vivid, immersive environment, making the Salvage Yards feel alive with history, danger, and the remnants of past lives.
#### Scrapyard Creatures
##### Bullshit Made-up Creatures
These are a list of creatures I just kind of made up cause they sounded cool; check them off if they are used, then create an official stat block for them.

- [ ]  **Carrion Crawlers**: Large, insectoid creatures that feast on decaying matter, often found in the darkest, most foul-smelling parts of the yards.
- [ ]  **Shadows**: Malevolent, undead entities that drain the strength of the living, lurking in the darkest corners and crevices.

#### How is the Store Setup:
**Arnov:**
[[Arnov Vasilov]] is the owner of The Other Way. He specializes in sourcing magic items from far off lands. His stocks are dwindling but his spirits are high. He has connections to [[Yugo Stolid]] as well as the gambling den they speak of, far off in [[The Dark Woods]]. 

*Something for [[Wake Tiraus]]*:
He was once apart of [[Fedorov's Legion]] before he escaped. Friendly to those who oppose them and knows about [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]]. "I would never forget the looks of people that worked for [[Fedorov's Legion]], always have a look of madness and cruelty in their eyes." He has seen two men, [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]] (not that he knows them by name), around the town very recently. Like the same day the group enters the shop. 

**Things Arnov can do for people:**
- Identify a magic item, and give info about its history
- Buy a magic item for a discount price
- Sell a magic item at a hugely overprice amount 
- Play games of luck and fate, gambling items for items

### Rock Bottom:
>A beat down looking bar, once made from heavy slabs of dark stone. Now it sits desolate and disused, the stone blocks crumbles to rubble. Lichen grows all over as the roof is fractured and destroyed.

**Abandoned:**
Prior to the raid on the town, this was a bustling point of drinking for your average working townsperson. It was simple, municipal, but lively at night. It had fair, generous prices and hearty food. Many came here for simple nights with good memories. However now, the building is closed being half destroyed from the raid. On the premises sit numerous shells of giant crabs, tantamount to the viciousness of the raid. 
### Chugga's:
>Chugga's is a notorious, rowdy tavern where bad ale and even worse liquor flow freely from dawn till the wee hours. The dimly lit interior is a chaotic blend of laughter, shouting, and the occasional brawl, making it a magnet for sailors, adventurers, and anyone looking to forget their troubles. The rough wooden tables and chairs bear the scars of countless drunken nights, and the air is thick with the smell of spilled beer and pipe smoke.
>
>The tavern's infamous tournaments of [[Ball Knockers]] — A relatively sophisticated game of billiards combined with gambling — and Chug contests, where participants race to down tankards of the foulest brews, are the stuff of legend. These events draw a crowd of spectators and competitors eager to prove their mettle and perhaps win a few coins, though most leave lighter in the pocket and heavier in the head.
>
>Gambling is rampant at Chugga's, with dice games, card tables, and impromptu bets springing up in every corner. The raucous atmosphere is overseen by the burly and ever-watchful owner, Chugga, whose booming voice can silence even the rowdiest of patrons. His presence ensures that, while chaos reigns, things never get completely out of hand.
>
>The walls of Chugga's are adorned with a mismatched collection of maritime relics, hunting trophies, and dubious "art," each with its own tale of misadventure. Despite the rough crowd and questionable beverages, there's a certain camaraderie and thrill that keeps patrons coming back, night after wild night.

**Interesting Patrons:**
- Chugga the tavern keep keeps a watchful eye over the room
	- Chugga is a HUGE orc, built like an 800 pound cube with a massive apron that says Chugga Chugs 
	- Chugga is strong, high con, charismatic, and wise. His dex and int blow 
- [[Glorval]] and [[Glee Bishop]], [[Ball Knockers]] duo of doom, play the  ball knockers tables
#### Drinks at Chugga's:
- The Big Chug = massive barrel of ale. If you order you *must* chug it in 30 seconds or you will get thrown out to incredibly loud applause.
- Normal Ale
- Vintage Fire Wine = burns intensely and dulls your perception but increases you strength 
- The Seducer Shot = turns you into a love machine, advantage on charisma checks and saves
- **Drinks from the Breweries of Brine**:
	- *Sea Salt Beer* = salty after taste, cheap. Burps taste like the ocean
	- *Aged Seaweed Wine* = expensive, complex taste, allows user to speak to sea creatures very briefly if it is used to get someone VERY drunk. 
	- *Coral-Cask aged Whiskey of the Sea* = imbued with strength of coral. If used to get someone VERY drunk, they have resistance to slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage but have disadvantage on saves, ability checks, and attack roles since they are VERY disoriented. 
	- *Jelly-Venom Infused Mead* = deliciously sweet and deliciously deadly, a mead made from the venom of a deadly jellyfish named [[Yellow Cap Killers]]. When drunk, the brew can give either resistance or immunity to poison damage depending on how much is consumed. To get resistance, consume a small amount and pass a DC 13 Con save. To get immunity, pass a DC 18 Con save. On a failure, resistance-consumption gives the poisoned condition for 24 hours until cured. For immunity-consumption, the potion gives a madness as well as the poisoned condition for 24 hours.

- It is also very high magic with tall vaulted ceilings wreathed with swirling magical tides.

#### Hookers have info:
Since hooker or workers get to see some pretty diverse clients, they have access to a lot of information. They will divulge it for a fee of course. Or a favor depending on the worker. 
### Starlight Archives:
>A once beautiful white building with elegant stained glass windows is now a half burnt shell, the fantastic windows shattered and destroyed. The building closed the the public.
### The Temple Glade:

> [!NOTE] Description of Temple Glade
> Temple Glade lies in stark contrast to the bustling village of Gullhook, separated by rugged, rocky terrain that creates a natural barrier between the sacred site and the rest of the world. This serene sanctuary is located at the heart of a vast, mirror-like lake, its waters calm and reflective, yet teeming with hidden dangers. Beneath the placid surface, crocodiles and other ancient, lurking creatures patrol the depths, serving as both guardians and reminders of the untamed power that surrounds the glade.
>
The glade itself is dominated by a single island at the center of the lake, where the majestic Temple of Alsolace stands. This radiant structure, with its white marble walls and golden accents, gleams brightly under the sun, a beacon of divine light in an otherwise remote and secluded landscape. The temple is accessible only by three ancient rope bridges, each stretching across the water from different points along the rocky shore. These bridges, swaying gently with each step, serve as the sole connection between the glade and the outside world, making every visit a deliberate and introspective journey.
>
Encircling the temple on the island’s edge are numerous shrines dedicated to both the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods. Each shrine is a reflection of the deity it honors—some are imposing and shadowed, draped in dark cloth and lit by flickering candles, while others are bright and welcoming, adorned with vibrant flowers and offerings left by the faithful. Banners bearing the sunburst symbol of Alsolace, the Golden God, flutter in the breeze, their golden threads catching the light and casting shimmering patterns on the lake’s surface.
>
The temple keepers, cloaked in pristine white hooded robes, move silently about their duties, maintaining the sanctity of the temple and the shrines with a quiet, reverent efficiency. Their faces remain hidden within the deep folds of their hoods, adding to the aura of mystery and sacredness that pervades the glade. These keepers are a constant presence, their calm and measured actions underscoring the peaceful yet powerful atmosphere of the glade.
>
Temple Glade is a place of profound reflection and worship, where the devout come to seek guidance and offer prayers in the presence of the gods. The journey across the rope bridges, over the predator-filled waters, serves as a symbolic passage from the mundane world into the divine, marking this as a place where the sacred and the natural world intersect in a delicate balance.
>
The entire area is surrounded by water, kind of like a ring that you cross via a bridge. There are decadent trees lazily gracing the waters and guards and holy members standing on each of the bridges. There are three bridges, North, East, and West, and no South bridge because it is said that to go South is to go backwards in your life. 

#### Areas of the Glade
##### The Sunken Sanctuary 
Beneath the tranquil surface of the lake, hidden away from the prying eyes of [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]], lies the **Sunken Sanctuary**. Accessible only by diving down to a concealed underwater entrance near the temple's stone foundation, the sanctuary is a relic of the temple's original purpose—a place of true worship and connection to the gods before the deception of Alsolace took root.

**Description:** The sanctuary is an air-filled cavern, its walls adorned with ancient mosaics that depict the worship of the Prime Deities and Betrayer Gods. The mosaics are partially defaced, with symbols of Alsolace crudely overlaid, a testament to the deliberate erasure of the temple’s true history. The centerpiece of the room is a grand altar made of sunstone, its surface etched with ancient runes that still pulse with a soft, golden light. The air here is thick with a sense of loss, but also with the faint, lingering presence of the gods who were once honored in this sacred space.

**Interactions:**

- **Activating the Altar**: If the players examine the sunstone altar and manage to decipher the runes (perhaps requiring a successful Religion or Arcana check), they can activate a latent divine power. The altar can grant a brief glimpse of the past, showing the players visions of the temple before [[Tennyson Heralds]]'s corruption. They may see the true gods worshipped here, the rituals performed, and even the moment when [[Tennyson Heralds]] first set his plan into motion.
- **Cleansing the Mosaics**: The players might attempt to cleanse the defaced mosaics, either by magical or mundane means. If successful, they will reveal the true symbols of the original deities, weakening [[Tennyson Heralds]]'s hold over the glade. This could also trigger a surge of divine energy, healing the party or granting them a boon for their efforts to restore the temple’s honor.
- **Confronting the Spirits**: Disturbing the sanctuary may awaken the spirits of the ancient priests, who have been bound here since [[Tennyson Heralds]]'s betrayal. These spirits could either aid the players, offering guidance and knowledge, or they might test the players’ resolve, challenging them to prove their worthiness.
##### The Mirror of Reflections
Tucked away behind a rocky outcrop on the far side of the island lies the **Mirror of Reflections**—a secluded alcove where a shallow pool of crystal-clear water rests, undisturbed by the chaos of the outside world.

**Description:** The pool’s surface is impossibly smooth, reflecting the sky and surrounding rocks with perfect clarity. However, this is no ordinary reflection. The water is enchanted, and those who gaze into it see more than just their physical appearance—they see their true selves, their deepest desires, fears, and even the lies they live by. For [[Tennyson Heralds]] or any of [[The Followers of Alsolace]], the pool shows them the deceitful figures they’ve become, shattering any illusion of righteousness.

**Interactions:**

- **Revealing the Truth**: If a player gazes into the pool, they may see a vision of the truth behind [[Tennyson Heralds]] and his fabricated deity. This could provide them with crucial information about the false god’s creation, including the methods [[Tennyson Heralds]] used to convince the townsfolk and how to potentially undo the deception.
- **Breaking the Illusion**: A character who is deeply connected to [[The Followers of Alsolace]] may experience a crisis of faith when confronted by their reflection in the pool. This could lead to a roleplaying moment where they question their beliefs, possibly even defecting from the followers if persuaded by the party.
- **Unlocking Hidden Potential**: The Mirror might also reveal a hidden strength or potential within a character, granting them a temporary boost to their abilities or inspiring them with newfound purpose. This could manifest as a temporary increase in Wisdom or Charisma, or perhaps a one-time divine intervention in a moment of need.
- **A False Aura:** The pool actually reflects and shows hideous or beautiful auras depending on what someone is hiding. The auras appear as a shimmering silhouette around a creature's reflection and the stronger the related emotion, the more vibrant the color that appears. A creature can see the colors around any other creature who is at all visible in the pool's surface. 
	- *Black* for a dark, hidden truth
	- *Crimson* for a lying, deceitful, or murderous creature
	- *Orange* for a vengeful or resentful creature
	- *Royal Blue* for a a creature of pure heart, innocent soul, or honorable desire
	- *Amber* for a creature who's troubled, lost, or hopeful 

##### The Shrine of Lost Light
Behind the main temple, nestled within a narrow rock crevice, lies the **Shrine of Lost Light**—a small, somber place dedicated to those who have strayed from their faith, now overshadowed by the false god [[Alsolace]].

**Description:** The shrine is dimly lit by a single, ever-burning candle, its flame flickering weakly in the darkness. The walls are covered in carvings of names, some fresh and others centuries old, of those who once sought redemption here. At the base of the candle, offerings of old coins, dried flowers, and trinkets lay scattered, a sparse collection compared to the wealth hoarded by [[Tennyson Heralds]] and his followers.

**Interactions:**

- **Restoring the Light**: If the players manage to reignite the shrine’s power—perhaps by offering something of great personal value or performing a sacred rite—they can restore the candle’s flame to its former brilliance. This act could dispel some of the corrupt influence of [[Tennyson Heralds]] , weakening [[The Followers of Alsolace]] and causing the white-hooded temple keepers to falter in their devotion.
- **Communing with the Forgotten**: The shrine may serve as a conduit to the souls of those who sought redemption here before [[Tennyson Heralds]] ’s takeover. The players could attempt to communicate with these lost souls, gaining valuable insights into the temple’s history or learning of hidden weaknesses in [[Tennyson Heralds]] ’s plans.
- **A Beacon of Hope**: Restoring the shrine might have broader implications, such as spreading a subtle but pervasive sense of hope throughout Gullhook. The townsfolk, once blindly devoted to [[Alsolace]], might begin to question their faith, providing the players with an opportunity to rally support against [[Tennyson Heralds]] .
##### The Celestial Observatory 
High above the temple, carved into the rocky cliffs behind the glade, lies the **Celestial Observatory**—a forgotten relic of the temple’s true purpose, now largely ignored by [[The Followers of Alsolace]].

**Description:** The observatory is an open platform with no roof, offering an unobstructed view of the night sky. Ancient star maps are etched into the stone floor, showing the movements of celestial bodies and the paths of the true gods. Around the edges of the platform, several bronze telescopes, now tarnished and neglected, point toward the heavens. The air here feels different, charged with the residual energy of countless prayers and rituals once conducted under the stars.

**Interactions:**

- **Revealing the Deception**: If the players study the star maps or use the telescopes, they may discover hidden messages left by the original priests. These messages could include warnings about [[Tennyson Heralds]]'s arrival, or even a prophecy detailing how to dismantle the false god’s influence over the temple. This knowledge could be pivotal in turning the tide against [[The Followers of Alsolace]].
- **Unlocking Celestial Power**: By performing a long-forgotten ritual under the stars, the players might tap into the lingering divine energy of the observatory. This could grant them a temporary boon, such as enhanced vision, insight, or a protective aura that shields them from the influence of [[Tennyson Heralds]] and his followers.
- **Calling Down the Stars**: If the players manage to reactivate the observatory’s ancient mechanisms, they could summon a celestial event—a meteor shower, an eclipse, or a convergence of stars—that might have a profound impact on the temple and its followers. This event could cause a mass revelation among [[The Followers of Alsolace]], revealing the truth about [[Tennyson Heralds]]'s deception and causing unrest or outright rebellion within the cult.

These enhanced descriptions provide players with rich, interactive elements within Temple Glade, each offering a deeper connection to the true history of the place while also presenting opportunities to challenge or undermine the influence of [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]].
#### Rules of the Holy Grounds
No matter what strife comes between citizens of [[Gullhook]], there is a sacred rule at the Temple Glade: No violence on the presences what so ever. There are guards that affiliate with the Temple Glade and they strictly prohibit violence and will imprison anyone that starts a fight. 

**Subverting this:** [[The Followers of Alsolace]] have bribed some guards with a share of the proceeds from the exploits of the followers. In return these guards will follow [[The Followers of Alsolace]] when they jump ship and leave the town. These guards will turn a blind eye to violence caused by [[The Followers of Alsolace]] but will attempt to arrest any creature resisting or doing violent acts of their own. A guard can be *recognized as a bribed guard* if they *speak positively about [[Alsolace]] and loves working at the glade*. A guard that has *not been bribed* *frowns on [[Alsolace]]* and wishes to be *reassigned back to another part of town*.

**Tennyson is violent:** [[Tennyson Heralds]] is violent and abducts and drugs people. Despite his good notoriety in the town and his *generous* contributions to the town guard, he would still be subject to the same laws of the town as anyone else, unless confronted by the Guards whom he bribed. If brought up to an honest guard, showing them proof it is likely that they would help and gather a force to oust [[Tennyson Heralds]]
#### Shrine to the Gods

> [!NOTE] Shrines Description
> In the heart of Temple Glade lies the Sacred Circle, a serene and reverent space dedicated to the worship of both the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods. Each shrine, meticulously crafted, reflects the unique nature and domain of the deity it honors, creating a powerful atmosphere of divine presence.
>
Surrounding the shrines are additional facilities designed to enhance spiritual and physical well-being. Healing hot springs, naturally heated by geothermal forces beneath the island, bubble up in secluded pools. These springs are known for their restorative properties, soothing aches and wounds, and providing a tranquil space for contemplation.
>
Adjacent to the springs, steam rooms carved into the rocky terrain offer a space for purification and renewal. The warm, humid air is infused with herbs, helping to cleanse both body and spirit, leaving visitors refreshed and revitalized.
>
For those seeking deeper meditation, there are several meditation rooms scattered throughout the glade. These rooms are simple yet elegant, adorned with symbols of the gods and designed to be quiet sanctuaries where visitors can connect with the divine, reflect on their journey, or seek guidance.
>
Each element within the Sacred Circle—the shrines, the hot springs, the steam rooms, and the meditation chambers—contributes to an atmosphere of deep peace and spiritual resonance. Visitors leave the Sacred Circle not just physically restored, but spiritually uplifted, their souls touched by the divine presence that permeates the glade.

#### The Temple's Workers
The workers of temple glade actually are [[The Followers of Alsolace]], led by [[Tennyson Heralds]]. He is a mad preacher who "hails from the hidden forests ([[The High Forests]] and also total BS)." He uses smooth words, reassurance, and firm preaching to rally those who surround him.
##### A Sinister Connection
The following actually works really closely with [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] and abducts people from town and sends them over to the slave house. They have been targeting grieving people from the recent raids. They bring them into private rooms to pray, drug them, and then cart them over. They are working closely with [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]] who are helping with this. 
# How they Fish:
> Large rune-rocks dot the coast here. They swirl with vibrant magical energy as mages, rock-tenders they are called, stand to invoke them on wooden scaffolding. A coordinator stands by the cliff on a raised wooden platform issuing signals to the rock-tenders. Ships float up the cliff, wrapped in an arcane embrace as the mages set them down upon wooden berthing docks, arranged in neat rows near the cliff. Cargo and fishing catches levitate out of hulls and nets and are set down in neat sorting piles nearby. 
## The Magic Rune Rocks:
Huge, towering magic rocks with scaffolding built on the sides of them channel magical runes throughout the air near ish to the cliffs. Rock-tenders control the rocks through rhythmic dances, song, chanting, and hand movements. Some rocks stand right on the cliffs and others stand further in from the cliff. Ships get passed from rock to rock by the rock-tenders to move them around. 

They give off signatures of **conjuration** and **transmutation**. 
### Rune Rock Abilities
When invoked, they make heavy objects very light and can levitate them. Rock-tenders are able to invoke the rocks through their ways to lift ships up the cliffs and then hand them to other rock-tenders further inland to set down. 

They can also be used to levitate moving creature, so the town guard uses them in emergency to detain criminals if they are in the area. 

### Secret: The Rocks of the Many?
They are actually a small project of [[The Many]], mostly a gag idea but expanded on later to help quarry places which eventually created the sea caves of [[Shimmer Mist Lagoon]], [[The Echoing Grotto]], and [[The Sunken Caverns]]. 
# Special Interactive Events:
These are events that are not listed as bad effects, like at the beginning of the document.
