# Description:
Gandoras City is located to the south-east of [[King Gillian's Channel]] and is apart of [[The North-West Highlands]]. It is considered the largest city on the Island of Mist.
# Trading:
The City trades runs all over and the following shows a little bit of where imports and exports com from and go to in the city.
### Imports:
#### [[King Gillian's Channel]]:
The city of gandoras regulates [[King Gillian's Channel]], exacting a hefty tax over any cargo ship who wishes to sail through it. Taxes are taken in the form of a percentage of cargo for cargo ships, and in gold for non-cargo ships.

**Taxing Cargo Ships:**
Cargo ships are taxed at 10% the value of their cargo holds. Captains report the value of their holds at entrance to the channel. Some captains lie about their hold value; if they are caught lying, the tax is increased to 50% the hold value. 

**Enforcing the Channel:**
Guard ships from Gandoras station themselves 24/7, on rotation, at both North and South entrances to the channel. There are docks, built into massive caverns in the great walls of the channel (remember the walls are around 150-200 feet tall). These caverns, at both entrances, serve as docks for ships entering the channel. All ships must dock when entering, and a representative of Gandoras will board the ship, and then sail with it up the channel to Gandoras. Another representative will sail the second leg of the journey for ships leaving Gandoras. 

If a ship chooses not to dock, enforcer ships will give chase. Sending stones are used to communicate between entrances at the main city so even if a ship escapes the channel enforcers, they will be caught before getting to Gandoras. 
### Exports:
#### The North-West Supply Caravan:
The city organizes a merchant caravan to supply villages up and along the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]]. This carries necessary goods and stops at every village along the coast. One caravan runs each week and will return back to the city within 3 weeks. 

# Guilds:
#### The North-West Trader's Guild:
This is the only trade union in the city. A merchant can register into the union at any point. Most skippers sailing the channel will register their ships with the NW Trader's Guild. You pay an additional 1% of your cargo hold value to the guild but they also give you access to trader's housing, trader's markets, and guild protection while your ship is in the harbor at Gandoras.
