Many years ago, a large channel was build to divide the North-West from the North-East. It was a project of a great king named King Gillian. His other heroics have been lost to time, but the large channel stands as a testament to his reign.

The channel spans from the North-Sea all the was south to the bay at the south of [[The North-West Highlands]]. It is wide enough for two ships to sail in parallel next to each other.

### Politics of the Channel:
King Gillian's channel is controlled by [[Gandoras City]], the largest town right between [[The North-West Highlands]] and [[The North-East Forests]]. The channel flows right through the center of the great town and is spanned by countless bridges to allow the city to function. All ships who traverse the channel have to be able to pay a tax of 10% the value of their cargo. It is steep, very steep but it is necessary. The channel is expensive to maintain and patrol. Most captains will readily pay the cost if it means circumventing the treacherous waters of the North-West. 

As a general note, most sailors loathe sailing along the North-West coasts that border [[The North-West Highlands]]. According to them the seas are unpredictable and there is the distinct sense of foreboding when they sail there. Many an ancient legend has massive sea creatures dwelling near the coast there. It is not without merit of course, great sea creatures DO live there. They also complain about the weird field of magical obelisks off the tip of the North-West. Many a ship has sunk sailing through the field and it is not a chance a captain with a laden trade vessel is willing to take. 

The sailors who live in [[The North-West Highlands]] have no such fears and laugh at the prospect of using a channel when the seas suffice just fine for sailing.
