Small town along the north of [[The North-West Highlands]]. It is close to the high white cliffs of the north seas and often rests under a cool blanket of sea mist.

[[Vivian Lovejoy]] has a library here called the Library of Saddle-Port and her son, [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] lives here. 

# At First Glance:
	You crest a small knoll, the waving sea grass scratching at your knees. In the distance you can see a small town situated between two small hills -- Saddle-Port. A wisp of smoke rises from a couple chimneys in the town. It's calm. The houses have thatches sea grass roofs and are made from glimmering coral stone. You can see a couple people sitting outside on the veranda of a larger tavern and off in the distance, you see a glimmering sea-glass dome of what appears to be a library.

# Parts of the Town:
	Saddle-Port is small -- Less than a hundred people call this small town home. On the outskirts are quant cottages, each with a trodden dirt path leading into town. In the town there is the library, the tavern, the market stalls, and a trading post. There is a small open area where events are hosted but it is small. Towards the cliff's edge are the docks; ships are set in rails on the dry docks and are hoisted to and from the sea using pulleys and cattle.

#### The Library:
This library is run by [[Vivian Lovejoy]]. It has a small adjacent cottage where [[Vivian Lovejoy]] and her adopted son [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] live. 

The library contains a lot of textbook and treatises, magical tomes on spell casting, and folk hero tales. Notably, the collection contains a first edition of [[Book - The Greatest of the Great]], a tale about the exploits of the late, great wizard -- [[Ignel Valis]]. 

The books are all on shelves in a circular room with a colorful, stained glass dome overhead. It makes the room shift and glimmer with beautiful, colorful lights. 

#### The Tavern:
The tavern is pretty run-of-the-mill. It has a simple, well stocked bar tended by a man named Herbert Shaw. There is a small attached kitchen that serves meals of the sea, almost all being made with fish. The cook's name is Alice Shaw and she is Herbert's wife. 

The tavern has small gambling game nights, playing [[Black-wing's Duels]] and [[Dragon's Hoard Twenty-One]] on most nights. There is also a dart board, riddled with holes from its frequent use.

1. Herbert Shaw: Older, no hair and bald, multiple scars from when he worked on fishing boats. Likes to tell stories.
2. Alice Shaw: Older, flowing grey hair and keen eyes. Friendly laugh and enjoys talking about the specials for the day that she is cooking.

#### The Trading Post:
Saddle-Port, like many towns, has a small trading port where merchant cargos sell small amounts of their goods to the local tender. This trading post is run by a man named Yugo Stolid.  

Carried are simple goods, two healing potions, and a potion of water breathing. He has many troves of old fishing gear. He also knows when the next caravan is due in because they run on a relatively regular schedule. 

The trading post also stocks basic food supplies from a supply caravan that runs up the coast from [[Gandoras City]]. 

1. Yugo Stolid: Young and squat halfling who is very noticing. Good at bartering to make a sale.

#### The Market Stalls:
Goods are sold here daily. Fishermen bringing in a catch sell their goods here to the local people. People with gardens will bring some of their produce to sel
