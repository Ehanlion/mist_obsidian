Feelers:
-  Tall, bright white cliffs rising out from the crashing seas beneath. The booming of the waves echoes up to those standing at the crests of the cliffs.
-  Salty, sea winds blowing in over the white cliffs. With them a cool mist blows through in the mornings, casting a cool embrace over the highlands in the dawn hours. 
-  Sweeping hills and knolls dot the highlands as far as the eye can see. 
-  The vast [[King Gillian's Channel]] divides the highlands from [[The North-East Forests]].
