	If you stand on the highlands and gaze out towards the sea, you are met with a cool breeze to your face -- a salty breeze that tickles at your chin. The tall sea grass of the knoll you stand upon tickles at your knees and if you close you eyes, you can hear but only the swishing of the grass in the gentle blowing breeze. If you walk towards the ocean, you'll be taken aback by the massive cliffs. The entire highlands, seperated from the ocean by cliffs of white rock, standing over a hundred feet tall. They are steep in parts, but not unpassable. 

These are the North-West highlands, the north-west of the island of Mist. They are a large plateau of highlands, standing hundreds of feet from the sea below with massive white rock cliffs. Even still, this is the region that relies the most on fishing. Fishermen and village make their own ways to get ships to and from the sea.

This is a relaxed place. Towns have strong familial ties and are very communal. The neighboring villages help each other in rough times, but often stay apart. There is not much need to interact too much.
