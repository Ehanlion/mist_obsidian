# Description:
These are the followers of the great crustacean, [[Karak-Ulgurath]], the crab silently terrorizing [[The North-West Highlands]]. 
# Mutations:
All followers of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] are mutated in some form or another. They might have barnacle growths on them improving their armor or a new pseudopod limb that seemingly acts on its own. All of them have tainted, darker skin of a cascade of colors, similar to that of the colors of coral found in the depths of [[The Sunken Caverns]].
