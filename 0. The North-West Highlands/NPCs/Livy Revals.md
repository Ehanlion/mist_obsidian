# Backstory:
Old friend of [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] when he was yet to be leader of [[Fedorov's Legion]]. In fact they travelled together extensively for fun across the [[The South-East Coast]] as well as [[The Dark Woods]]. Together they sired a secret child before [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] assume control of [[Fedorov's Legion]]. Although [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] moved on, and got married, she pushed to remain close. Out of lust for wanting him back from his current wife, she performed unthinkable acts in the form of an underground slave ring that pipelined directly to [[Fedorov's Legion]]. 

In all truth, she is just heartbroken that she both had his child and he abandoned her. However, she is now severely messed up in the head, a little insane, and not at all her once beautiful self. She raised the child for him before sending him to [[Hope Town]] for his raising to be completed under supervision of the child's father. The child is now a servant to [[Fedorov's Legion]] with no clue about his identity. He is the rightful heir to the throne and not one of [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]'s other, despicable and cruel children.
