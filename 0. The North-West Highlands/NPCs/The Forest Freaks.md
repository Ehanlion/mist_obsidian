Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Lives in [[The High Forests]], steals from supply caravans between [[Trawlrock]] and [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and then [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]] and [[Gullhook]]. 
# Description:
A group of young rascals that raid the supply caravans and other supply trade between the north most cities across [[The North-West Highlands]]. They don't often kill, only knock unconscious and steal from the KO'd people. In reports guards make, the group wears large, oversized masks, attack using blowpipes and darts laced with sleeping agents. They jump from trees and bushes out of no where and leave as quickly as they arrived, usually with all of the valuables from the traders. 
# Location:
They have a hide out, hidden deep within [[The High Forests]], specifically the untamed verdant section. Its actually located within another compound, secretly from [[The Many]] (not that they know this). Unlike the one used by [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], this compound's entrances were open when they found it. The vaulted doors, blown to smithereens.
