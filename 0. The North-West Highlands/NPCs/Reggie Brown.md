Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Missing from [[Smears-burrow]]
# Description:
Reggie, to his friends known as R.B., is an average fisherman. He has a tangled mop of hair, often with tangles of seaweed in it. He has a portly belly and notably, always wears a nice yellow overcoat while he is out fishing.
# Location:
Reggie lives in [[Smears-burrow]] and is a relatively well liked and notable fisherman there. 

He captains a single fishing vessel by the names of the Blessed Bream. It is small -- at max capacity, maybe 10 men could accompany the skipper. It is equipped with a couple fishing pole stands, some nets, and some harpoons for shallows fishing. 
# Man Missing:
Reggie has recently gone missing from [[Smears-burrow]]. He was last reported leaving on his fishing boat and sailing along the coast to fish in the shallows. Importantly, it is known that he is NOT missing from a raid that happened at [[Smears-burrow]] because he went missing BEFORE the raid that happened. 

More details about where his body can be found are contained with the 'Sad fisherman' hook of [[Mission, Welcome to Mist]].
