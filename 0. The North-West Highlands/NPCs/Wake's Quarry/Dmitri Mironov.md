Works for [[Fedorov's Legion]]. With the help of [[Igor Larionov]] they killed two weapons-smiths that were illegally working for [[The Blue Coat Brigade]].

#### The Hunted:
Dmitri is one of the two people that [[Pavel Hard]] tasked [[Wake]] with killing in an act of revenge.

Dmitri has been tasked by [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] to go check on the enslaved Crab that is currently being used to conduct raids and the enslaving efforts along [[The North-West Highlands]]. 

Dmitri will NOT give up his motives ever under pain of death because he knows that [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] would have him executed.
