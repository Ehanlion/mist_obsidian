Local fisherman with a sunk ship in [[Saddle-Port]]. This ship is called the "Stan-ta Ray."

# Description:
Barney is young but looks old. The sea weathers most people, and Barney looks like the sea aged him about 30 years past where he is now. His face is wrinkled, his hair grayed. In some way or another, he always manages to have wet clothes.

#### his ship:
Barney has a ship named "The Stan-ta Ray." It was named for his brother, Stan, who passed before the ship was built. The ship is simple, about 30 feet long with a single mast.
