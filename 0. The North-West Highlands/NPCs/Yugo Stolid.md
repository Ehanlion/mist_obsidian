Short, stout, and young halfling with a thick accent (use a deliberately bad Russian accent). He has funny mannerisms and likes to play with his guests. Seems to always let someone in on a little secret with him to make guests feel special. Secrecy between customers and [[Yugo Stolid]] helps his business.
