# Description:
Igor is a squat, short halfling with one eye and a body that is covered in tattoos symbolizing his allegiance to [[Fedorov's Legion]]. He has gold teeth smattering in his smile. 
# Mission for [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]:
Igor, along with [[Dmitri Mironov]], has been tasked with checking upon [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and seeing if the efforts of the massive crustacean have yielded results yet. He is currently in [[The North-West Highlands]]. The mission of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is detailed in [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. 

Igor will reveal information, only if the party guarantees that they can hide him from [[Fedorov's Legion]], since they will surely kill him for betraying them and giving up information. The party doesn't have to uphold this, it is their choice. He is desperate.
