# Description: 
Erstorndin is the evil god of darkness and rot. He festers in shadows of fear and animosity. He preys on those un-united and separated by striking them down. He purveys small deeds, people go missing in the night, villages will fall in fire, crops and livestock will die is Erstorndin is left to his device unopposed. 

Erstorndin's will is enforced by lawless and ruthless brigands who slaughter and pillage towns in the name of Erstorndin.
