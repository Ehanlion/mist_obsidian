Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: A growing cult spreading across towns. Started in [[Schooner's End]] and is beginning to spread up the coast.
# The followers of Alsolace:
Groups come to villages as travelling ministers of the good god [[Alsolace]]. They do not preach desperately for those in the village to join their order. They do not force anyone to join in the hands of [[Alsolace]], the golden light. No, they preach that [[Alsolace]] is a loving and accepting god; [[Alsolace]] accepts anyone for any of their beliefs and for any of their beliefs in another God. 
## Creating Stat Blocks
### Enlightened Ones
The upper echelon of the followers. They are powerful and exalted, some even wielding magic of their own. Although of those that do, it is important to know that they *are clerics* and derive their power from [[The Betrayer Gods]] and not one of [[The Prime Deities]] and certainly not [[Alsolace]]. 
### Devotees
### Followers
# Their True Nature:
The followers of [[Alsolace]] are a power-hungry cult. Their motives are well concealed in and amidst cunning misdirection and powerful speeches meant to enthrall the people listening to the followers. The follower's goal, empowered by their leader [[Tennyson Heralds]], is to convert all members of villages to the following of [[Alsolace]] and then rob them blind of all their gold that they give as tribute to shrines to [[Alsolace]].
# Shrines to Alsolace:
When members of the followers come to a village, they will eventually want to establish a shine to [[Alsolace]] somewhere in the village. Offering can be left to the shrine in the form of gold, since it is from volumes of gold that [[Alsolace]] draws his strength. 

**True nature of the shrines:**
The Shrines 'gold' donations and tributes are actually taken by the cult and set aside in bag to later be taken. The offerings and the statue itself are actually just wood coated in golden foil in order to give the appearance of being made from gold. 
# How do the Followers get Footholds in Villages?
The following is a itemized and chronological list of how the followers take up a footing in a given village.
1. A long follower enters the village preaching good will, acceptance, and generosity.
2. That follower begins preaching in the center of town about the acceptance of [[Alsolace]]. It is important that at this stage, [[Alsolace]] being the opposer to [[Erstorndin]] is mentioned.
3. Small things start to go wrong: a couple farm animals die, some crops get burned, small stuff like that.
4. The follower preaches that these small mis comings are the byproduct of [[Erstorndin]] at work and that worse is yet to come. 
5. Small raids of bandits that claim to be emissaries of [[Erstorndin]] begin to harass the town. These bandits work alongside the follower and the followers of [[Alsolace]] and share in the profits. 
6. Gradually, the follower of [[Alsolace]] will offer his god's help to stop these bandits of [[Erstorndin]] by constructing a shrine to [[Alsolace]] in the town, empowered by offerings of gold.
7. At some point, the raiders will come to the village with the followers of [[Alsolace]] and it is there that, with the power of song, the followers of [[Alsolace]] will repel the invaders. Of course, the invaders work with the followers, so it is all just a staged act.
8. After enough raids the townspeople give in and the raids begin to slow down. After the follower deems the town milked dry, the follower takes the gold from the shrine and leaves in the dead of night.
