# Description:
Alsolace is described as a good god, a golden god, a god of light and strength and unity. He is a god who grows powerful off loyalty and gold. The greater the unity of those who follow him and the greater the gold that lies in tribute to him, the greater the powerful Alsolace has.

Alsolace is preached as an accepting god, one who does not oppose dedication to other gods or other beliefs. Alsolace is preached as a god who protects anyone and everyone no matter what they believe, for that is the kind way of Alsolace. 

Alsolace bitterly opposes [[Erstorndin]] and, if the tributes from which Alsolace draws his strength are great enough, Alsolace can protect and defend the unwilling from the evil, vice grip of [[[Erstorndin]]].
