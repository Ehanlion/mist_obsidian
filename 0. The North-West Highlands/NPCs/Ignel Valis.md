(Val-is NOT Val-eese)
Powerful wizard. Someone who [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] looks up to with great reverence.
He now goes by the name 'Silvan Gile' (an anagram of Ignel Valis) and uses this name in Hope Town. As far as the people of Mist are concerned, it has been a long time since Ignel Valis was seen. 

Remember Ethan, DO NOT call Ignel as Ignel. His name is Silvan and will not answer to Ignel since he has made a new, secret life for himself in [[Hope Town]].
# Character Description:
>*Ignel stands erect and still. His form a paragon of perfect composure. His thick handlebar moustache covers the traces of a grin on his lips. His electric blue eyes seem to crackle with power and intrigue. He wears a simple red cloak that drapes down to his ankles. His clothes are simple but noticeably rich, with golden threads and subtle intricate weavings in the fabrics. He wields a tall staff and his boots seem to shimmer.*

**Deeper Description:**
-  Ignel is a male human. He is an evocation wizard.
-  He has voluminous hair, a stunning handlebar moustache, intelligent and piercing blue eyes and always a fain smile dancing across his lips.
-  Ignel is shorter than expected, only 5'5". His build is lithe and athletic with nondescript but strong muscles.
-  Staff of the Magi, [Boots of Golden Luck](https://www.5esrd.com/database/magicitem/boots-of-golden-luck/)
-  [Cloak of Eyes](https://www.5esrd.com/database/magicitem/cloak-of-eyes/) Ignel wears a weird cloak what appear to be bloody eyes on it; it is certainly unnerving. 
# Character Relationships: 
Ignel is a very worldly wizard and has travelled all over Mist in his many years of life. He knows are can draw from many connections.
- Ignel is revered by [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] as his hero. Ignel has had many books written about him and as such many wizard look up to him as a sort of hero, Kelswin included.
- Ignel is a close confident of [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and works for [[Fedorov's Legion]]. He is well known amidst the pirates for a different reason than he is known from the books about him. He WAS a heroic adventurer one day, but has since turned sour. His power helps the Legion dominate trade and remain as the most powerful faction in [[Hope Town]].

It should be noted that Ignel working for the Legion is a bit of knowledge that is very local to Hope Town. THAT IS BECAUSE IGNEL USES A DIFFERENT NAME THERE. He goes by Silvan Gile in Hope Town and not many there know his true identity. Only [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] knows that Silvan is in-fact Ignel. 
# Character Locations:
Ignel would be found in the palace of [[Fedorov's Legion]] along [[The South-East Coast]] in [[Hope Town]]. He frequents matches at [[Hugo's Arena]] and love [[The Pirate Fighting League]] and often referees for it, since Fedorov's Legion is in command of the fighting trade in Hope Town.
