Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Followers of [[Karak-Ulgurath]], originating from [[The Sunken Caverns]] and pillaging the coast bordered by [[The Distant Sea]].
# Description:
These are the followers of the great crustacean, [[Karak-Ulgurath]], the crab silently terrorizing [[The North-West Highlands]]. 
# Mutations:
All followers of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] are mutated in some form or another. They might have barnacle growths on them improving their armor or a new pseudopod limb that seemingly acts on its own. All of them have tainted, darker skin of a cascade of colors, similar to that of the colors of coral found in the depths of [[The Sunken Caverns]]. 
1. **Barnacled Growths:** Some creatures have clusters of barnacle growths on them. There growth leech onto internal organs of the creature. They have 20 hit point, immunity to psychic damage, and an AC of 18. They have a separate hit point pool to the creature they are attached to. When a monster with a barnacled growth is killed, the growth rolls a d20 and if it gets 10 or more, the creature revives with one hit point at the start of its turn. A creature can have multiple growths and if a creature dies with multiple growths, each one gets a chance at the save to revive the monster. 
# Location:
- Compound:
	- A large underground structure made long ago by [[The Many]]. They do now know about the origins but [[Ignel Valis]] (Silvan Gile) has some idea. 
	- It has two entrances, locked by a riddle detailed within [[Quest of the Riddle and Sea Caves]]. One is in [[The Bay of Kelp]] and one is in [[The High Forests]], specifically the Widow-maker's stands.
