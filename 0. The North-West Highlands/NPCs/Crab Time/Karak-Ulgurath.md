# The Crab Overlord:

# Description
[[Karak-Ulgurath]] is a massive, sentient crustacean that dwells deep within [[The Sunken Caverns]]. Amidst a plethora of notable features, the stone embedded within the crowning of its shell is distinct. This stone is a [[Mind Rock]] and it enable the crab to be controlled by its master. Beyond that the physical elements of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] are magnificent.

The crab is immense, towering over those who inevitably bow before it. Its shell is iridescent and illustrious, enchanting and bewitching any who regard it without caution. Its massive pincers could each crush a sailing vessel with ease. Its massive eyes, arranged on its broad crowning of its shell, pierce at you if you look at them. It almost compels you to obey it. It almost compels you to bow to [[Karak-Ulgurath]]. 
## True Nature
A crustacean this powerful or this massive in size is not normal. [[Ignel Valis]], a once-prominent hero was famous for his power as a mage and his love for crabs. In many of his journeys detailed in [[The Greatest of the Great]], [[Ignel Valis]] brought his pet crab named Karak with him. This crab is that very same crab, enhanced through some magical means and bonded with a [[Master Mind Rock]], controlled by [[Ignel Valis]]. Now though, the crab bows to [[Silvan Gile]], the new identity of [[Ignel Valis]]. 
## The Voice of Two
When [[Karak-Ulgurath]] speaks in its rumbly, ancient voice it is accompanies by another voice, a more sophisticated and *human voice*. This is the voice of [[Silvan Gile]] (really [[Ignel Valis]], but who's counting). They are layered upon each other and speak in harmony, almost. It is like the voice of [[Silvan Gile]], silky and smooth, comes *just before* the ancient and crackly voice of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] itself. It is notable that when this occurs, the speech patterns are far more eloquent, smooth, and educated whilst without the effect, they are curt, abrupt, and jittery. 
### Why does this happen?
[[Karak-Ulgurath]] has been embedded with a special [[Mind Rock]] which responds directly to A [[Master Mind Rock]], held and controlled by [[Silvan Gile]]. It allows the great mage to take special control of the crustacean pet he once adventured with. When required, he speaks through [[Karak-Ulgurath]], leading it in speech. 
# Mission
The crab is on a mission sent from [[Silvan Gile]]. It has been ordered to search for one of the [[Shards]] and [[Silvan Gile]] believes that it lies somewhere deep within [[The Sunken Caverns]]. [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is now using its mind-powering influence and abductions to power its underwater scouring of [[The Sunken Caverns]] in search of this one of the [[Shards]].
