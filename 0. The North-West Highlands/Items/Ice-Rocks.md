# Descriptions:
Ice Rock is a type of material hewn from the cliffs of [[The North-West Highlands]], near the towns of [[Smears-burrow]] and [[Saddle-Port]]. It has the odd property of being incredibly cold nearly all the time making it an excellent resource for keeping perishable goods cold for long times.
