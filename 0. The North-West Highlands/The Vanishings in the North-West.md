# The Issue:
Vanishings are happening along the North-West coast. This problem should pose a challenge to the players to uncover what is behind the vanishings, how to stop them, and how to get the people back. 

___
# At First:
Small vanishings up and along the coast. One or two people here or there from towns. [[Saddle-Port]] is the only town that has yet to have any vanishings. [[Smears-burrow]] was the last town to have a vanishing happen. 
#### Targeted people:
1. Miners
1. Librarians
2. Historians
#### Who is taking these people:
Groups of mutated sea creatures appear to be leading the raids.

1. [Deep Scion](https://5e.tools/bestiary/deep-scion-vgm.html) is a powerful, psionic shapeshifter with pseudopods swarming from its back. Good leader for raids.
2. [Kraken's Priests](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/kraken-priest) are powerful priests of the deep who can summon the calls of their masters to scare their enemies. Also a good leader for the raids.
3. [Merrow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16956-merrow) are good minions for the raids with a nice grappling attack.
4. [Saghuagin](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sahuagin#content) are also good, lesser minions. Weakest of the bunch.

___
# The Leader of the Raids:
A large, powerful crab that lives in a sea cave is controlling the raiders using its dominant will and mind control. It is also able to mind control the people that are taken in order to steal their memories and force them to work.
#### The Crab's dominion:
The crab, called Karak-Ulgurath by its followers, has taken up refuge in what is considered the most dangerous of the sea caves, deep at the bottom of it. It is looking for a key, called a shard by those who search for them.
#### Karak-Ulgurath (The Great Mind Crab):
Model its stats off of a [Merkoth](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/morkoth), replacing its spell casting with psychic spells like Psychic lance and stuff. Its big thing should be that it can enslave the minds of people it has dominated to work for it. 
#### The Crab but more:
The crab itself is a minion of a greater power -- [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] has worked with [[Ignel Valis]], now known as Silvan Gile, to enslave Karak-Ulgurath to their wills. 

A stone, embedded in the carapace of the crab controls it and enslaves it to the whim of [[Ignel Valis]]. If removed, the crab is still hostile but it fights for its own survival. If killed, the stone goes dormant. 

#### Curing the Enslaved People:
The stone that was embedded in the crab is called a Mind Rock, and the one on the crab is slaved to a Master Mind Rock that [[Ignel Valis]] owns.

Fedorov and Ignel as using the crab to search [[The North-West Highlands]] for a shard, one of the ancient artifacts of [[The Many]]. They do not KNOW what a shard is NOR do they know that what they are searching for is in fact, a shard.
