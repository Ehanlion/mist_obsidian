Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Side Quest, any town, [[The Distant Sea]], from a fisherman or wealth person.
# Description:
This quest has players hunt a baby kraken in [[The Distant Sea]]. There will be a section later for clues about its whereabouts and how to find the baby kraken.
# Quest Givers:
1. **The Honorable:** A fisherman who wants to get revenge for a friend who's ship was destroyed by a baby kraken. The fisherman has no ideas about its whereabouts but will provide a ship to the party and help them sail to find it. No gold reward here, just pure excitement.
2. **The Wealthy:** A wealthy collector wants the beak of a baby kraken for his collection of sea-beast related items. He is willing to pay 1000 gold but cannot provide a boat for the party. 

In general, who ever gives the quest should have limited information about the actual location of the baby kraken. However, information is available to the group if they look around for it.
# Gathering Clues:
The following is a list of potential clues that the party could get to either help them locate the baby kraken or bait it to attack them.
1. A Kraken's favorite food is **rotting whale blubber.** A kraken is sure to hunt with vigor if it can smell it. 
2. A Kraken can detect scent in the water for a range of 10 miles, giving it a highly precise way of hunting.
3. A Kraken loves to hunt near islands but hates coral reefs. 
4. The seas near a Kraken are said to smell sulphiric and metallic when a Kraken is within half of a mile. This can be hinted at to players by describing the sea changing aroma to 'like rotting eggs' or 'like the scent of an unoiled blade.'
# Best Locations to get information:
1. Any town by the sea would know **legends** about kraken but that also means that their facts may be less that accurate. If a player learns about krakens in this context, feel free to manipulate the clues in one small aspect.
2. Any island town would more concretely know about krakens because they pose a greater threat there. Towns like [[The Port of Last Call]], [[The Town of Frost-Haven]], or [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]], all towns in [[The Distant Sea]] off the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]], would know accurate versions of the clues.
