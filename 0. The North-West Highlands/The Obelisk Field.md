AI Art of a single example obelisk: ![[Obelisk field in north sea.png]]

>*All sailors who sail the North-West waters know of the Obelisk field. A large scattering of these broad, ancient pillars, swirling with runes and carved with runic engravings. There are 5 known obelisks, only one of which seems to be active. The active one glows a vibrant purple from the runes that are inscribed on it and the dancing runes in the air shimmer with vigor. The sea around it bubble and churns with ferocity.*

There are NOT just 5 obelisks. There are 8. Three are fully submerged underneath the water's surface because of where they were built. The obelisks can be activated if a 'shard' is placed into the activation chamber of an obelisk. More on this to come. While there ARE 8 obelisks and 8 schools of magic, there is no 

# Shape of the Obelisks:
Each obelisk is easily 50 feet wide and over 400 feet tall (so not small objects). For the 7 visible ones, only the top crux of the obelisk and a small bit of the sides shows, such that it pokes out maybe 60 feet from the ocean on a calm day. The Obelisks are made of dark black stone and are incredibly slick to the touch if you try to climb on them. On the East side of every obelisk there is a faint set of indents, making up a very slick ladder. This can be used to climb the sides. 

At the base of each obelisk, there is a doorway that has no lock. There is also a small, nearly invisible hatch built into the East side of the crux of the obelisk. Both entrances to the Obelisk are opened with an 'ACTIVATION KEY.' Touching the door, causes the outlined shape of it to flicked and then glow a dark purple color. There will appear to glow 4 small boxes on the door, 2 on each side. It is an indicator of where to put your hands. (The creatures who created this had 4 hands). If you know the key, it will read your mind and open. If not it will flash red and return to dormant. 

It is possible to smash through the doorway, though it requires an absurd amount of strength and the 'siege' attribute to your attacks.

##### At the top there is the following:
- A console at one side of the room. The console has a lever with writing beneath it. It also has a small glowing read-out of the formation of the obelisks. Activated ones glow Green, non-activated ones glow red, the center obelisk pulses red and is shaped like a small star (this is the control obelisk).
- A large metal disk, 10 feet wide, embedded in the floor in the middle of the room. It is very cold and has engravings on it.

#### Entering the Obelisk w/out the ACTIVATION KEY:
The one opened obelisk was done so with brute force. As such, whoever opened it encountered 'the defenders' at the top. Whoever opened it was powerful and defeated them, but it is still a notable threat. The defenders are magically and mechanically empowered constructs that wield one-handed lances and shields. 

# Obelisk Activation:
Obelisks can be activated by pairing them with a shard. There are 8 shards, each one takes a different form or appearance. Some have been melded with weapons to create powerful methods of destruction. Some have been melded with objects to create large areas of effect. 

# Why Are Some Obelisks Submerged?
These structures were built a long time ago, and the world was very different then. Of course, their creators knew that the world would change but it was an inevitability that they were prepared for. The Obelisks may appear to be scattered in a somewhat odd pattern, but that is only true if you look at the 5 visible ones, if you take into account the 3 submerged ones, they form the shape of a rune, called 'The Rune of Opening.'

The 'V' are visible obelisks and the 'H' are submerged obelisks. 

It should be noted that, as a general bit of knowledge, the depth of the ocean directly off the coast, for 1000 feet, is only around 500 feet deep. After that the ocean gets absurdly deep to the point where there is no ability to know just how deep it actually gets. Of course, that's just what the sailors of the island think. 

In reality, there is no bottom to the ocean. There. Is. No. Bottom. The ocean is just a by-way to the elemental plane of water, an entire plane consisting of only water. That is the reason for all the crazy sea creatures in the oceans. Remember, there are a WEIRDLY HIGH AMOUNT OF THEM and this is the reason for that.
