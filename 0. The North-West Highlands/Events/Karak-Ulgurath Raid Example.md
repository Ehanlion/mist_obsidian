Regional Locations: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Typical raid that occurs on towns, executed by [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]]
# Intents of the Raiders:
[[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] have been ordered to target specific niches of people. They go after **librarians** and **miners** with secondary targets being the supply caravans. The raiders search for books about hidden treasures and ancient tomes on the north west as well as mining tools such as pickaxes, explosives, etc. 
# Raid Methods:
The raiders prefer to sneak into towns at night and perform silent raids. However, they are equipped to handle sizeable resistance. They will only engage in intense fighting if there are notable defenses. Their lives are at stake if they fail the mission, so they are motivated to win at great cost. Nevertheless, if a force suffers 75% losses to its forces it will sound the general retreated and escape to the sea, where they know they have a significant advantage. 
# Raid Compositions:
Raiding parties are usually around 40 members, with larger ones pushing 60 and smaller ones closer to 30. All parties have a heavy unit, built for sieging, as well as a primary leader and a secondary leader, only to take command if the primary fails. They also have a few supporting casters, usually one per six creatures (because the casters use mass healing word, targeting 6 creatures), that focus on healing. 

**Heavy Units:**
Special creations of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] itself, built from crustacean shells in its image with powerful ranged attacks to slam and bombard defenses and buildings. The heavy units are only brought in via war horn if the village poses a threat to the raiders.

**Command Units:**
Command units are primary and secondary leaders of the group. They are brutish and strong, commanding forces to move. The initial plan is always to sneak in, so the secondary commander heads in with the sneaking group and sounds a war conch to alert the reserve forces if they need backup if they encounter resistance.

**Casting Support Units:**
Each general raid party has multiple casters, usually having one per 6 brute units to allow the caster to use mass healing word to heal all 6 brutes. Other than healing, they usually stand back and watch the brutes do the heavy lifting.

**Brutish Units:**
Every raid group has brute units that simply exist to do hard labor. They are just mindless, obedient fighters that ruthlessly follow commands of their leaders.
