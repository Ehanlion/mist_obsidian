Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Related to [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]].
# The Issue:
Vanishings are happening along the North-West coast. This problem should pose a challenge to the players to uncover what is behind the vanishings, how to stop them, and how to get the people back. 

___
# At First:
Small vanishings up and along the coast. One or two people here or there from towns. [[Saddle-Port]] is the only town that has yet to have any vanishings. [[Smears-burrow]] was the last town to have a vanishing happen. 
#### Targeted people:
1. Miners
1. Librarians
2. Historians
#### People by Town:
1. [[Saddle-Port]]:
	1. [[Vivian Lovejoy]]
2. [[Smears-burrow]]
	1. 
3. [[Gullhook]]
4. [[Herringshold]]
5. [[Schooner's End]]
6. [[Trawlrock]]
7. [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]]
#### Who is taking these people:
Groups of mutated sea creatures appear to be leading the raids.

1. [Deep Scion](https://5e.tools/bestiary/deep-scion-vgm.html) is a powerful, psionic shapeshifter with pseudopods swarming from its back. Good leader for raids.
2. [Kraken's Priests](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/kraken-priest) are powerful priests of the deep who can summon the calls of their masters to scare their enemies. Also a good leader for the raids.
3. [Merrow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16956-merrow) are good minions for the raids with a nice grappling attack.
4. [Saghuagin](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sahuagin#content) are also good, lesser minions. Weakest of the bunch

**It is even simpler than that:**
All that needs to happen in raids are for mutated, sea-looking creatures to come up from the cliffs or a part of town, steal people they are looking for, and fade back to the sea. 

___
# The Leader of the Raids:
A large, powerful crab that lives in a sea cave is controlling the raiders using its dominant will and mind control. It is also able to mind control the people that are taken in order to steal their memories and force them to work.
#### [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is the Crab Overlord:
[[Karak-Ulgurath]] is a corrupted [Merkoth](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/morkoth), and in combat should model its stats off of it. Replace its innate casting with psychic spells. With [[Karak-Ulgurath]], its big feature it its ability to mentally enslave creatures to its whim.

Using monster stat blocks: [Aboleth](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/aboleth) would make an excellent alternative to the Merkoth for a core stat block for the crab.

Lean heavy into this creatures ability to enslave others to its mind.
#### Where is [[Karak-Ulgurath]]?
[[Karak-Ulgurath]] has taken over a dark cave in the lower levels of [[The Sunken Caverns]]. 

___
# The True Masters:
The crab itself is enslave by a [[Mind Rock]], controlled by [[Ignel Valis]], of course now called Silvan Gile, who wields a [[Master Mind Rock]]. He is working alongside [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]. The Crab is essentially a drone that is issued orders by [[Ignel Valis]] and follows them to the best of its ability. 

#### Curing the Enslaved People:
The only way to cure the enslaved people is to have the wielder of the [[Mind Rock]] controlling the enslaved to will them to be free. That means either [[Karak-Ulgurath]] must be convinced to let them go free (never going to happen, [[Karak-Ulgurath]] fights to the death) OR a player must CHOOSE to touch the mind rock, succeed on the Charisma save against the rock, and then will the enslaved creatures free. 

If the [[Mind Rock]] that is bound to [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is simply destroyed, the people will be free, yes, but they will suffer permanent madness, uncurable by anything short of high level healing. 

#### Why is the Crab Needed?
[[Karak-Ulgurath]] is being used as essentially a giant crustacean controlling a mining operation, deep within [[The Sunken Caverns]]. It is searching for one of the [[Shards]]. [[Ignel Valis]] already knows about the [[Shards]] since he has one, Key 2 -- a small glowing blue key, and he wants another. He, nor [[Fedorov Barovick VII]], know the true nature of the Shards. 

If [[Ignel Valis]] or [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] were spotted leaving to visit [[The North-West Highlands]], [[Tergal the Fierce]] and [[Pavel Hard]] (leaders of the other pirate factions) would be suspicious. As a result, [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] has sent two of his cronies, [[Igor Larionov]] and [[Dmitri Mironov]] to murder members of [[The Blue Coat Brigade]], then 'escape' to [[The North-West Highlands]]. This gives them a cover story.

in reality, [[Igor Larionov]] and [[Dmitri Mironov]] are checking in on [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and they hope to see results from its mining, in the form of one of the [[Shards]]. Of course, they have no idea what the [[Shards]] are, and have simply been told they are finding 'something magical and powerful for the bosses.'
