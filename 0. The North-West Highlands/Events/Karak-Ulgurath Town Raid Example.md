Regional Locations: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Typical raid that occurs on towns, executed by [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]]
# Intents of the Raiders:
[[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] have been ordered to target specific niches of people. They go after **librarians** and **miners** with secondary targets being the supply caravans. The raiders search for books about hidden treasures and ancient tomes on the north west as well as mining tools such as pickaxes, explosives, etc. 
# Raid Methods:
The raiders prefer to sneak into towns at night and perform silent raids. However, they are equipped to handle sizeable resistance. They will only engage in intense fighting if there are notable defenses. Their lives are at stake if they fail the mission, so they are motivated to win at great cost. Nevertheless, if a force suffers 75% losses to its forces it will sound the general retreated and escape to the sea, where they know they have a significant advantage. 
# Raid Signals:
To communicate while in action, a raiding party has a series of commands and signals devised by [[Karak-Ulgurath]] for them to use. These include the usage of maritime noises as well as soundings from a conch shell, of which each raiding party has two.
1. **Hooting of an Owl:** Scouting force signaling they are moving in towards targets
2. **Whistling of a Sparrow:** Means that a target has been abducted
3. **3 Long Conch Blasts:** Signal indicates that scout force needs backup 
4. **5 Short Conch Blasts:** Signals general retreat for entire party
# Raid Compositions:
Raiding parties are usually around 40 members, with larger ones pushing 60 and smaller ones closer to 30. All parties have a heavy unit, built for sieging, as well as a primary leader and a secondary leader, only to take command if the primary fails. They also have a few supporting casters, usually one per six creatures (because the casters use mass healing word, targeting 6 creatures), that focus on healing. 

**Heavy Units:**
Special creations of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] itself, built from crustacean shells in its image with powerful ranged attacks to slam and bombard defenses and buildings. The heavy units are only brought in via war horn if the village poses a threat to the raiders. 
1. [Stone Giant](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/hill-giant) - use a stone giant stat block. Replace great club attacks with claw attacks. Replace rock throw with spit lob (flavor as an acrid attack that the crab gathers in its mouth before spitting), it deals acid damage and is siege, dealing double damage versus buildings. 

The crabs get ridden by reinforcement followers up the cliffs during the raids. While the raiding party travels, they cling to the underside of the ship that the party travels on. 

**Command Units:**
Command units are primary and secondary leaders of the group. They are brutish and strong, commanding forces to move. The initial plan is always to sneak in, so the secondary commander heads in with the sneaking group and sounds a war conch to alert the reserve forces if they need backup if they encounter resistance. 
1. [Sahuaguin Baron](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/sahuagin-baron) - Use normal baron for secondary leader and a baron with added health for the primary leader. 

**Casting Support Units:**
Each general raid party has multiple casters, usually having one per 6 brute units to allow the caster to use mass healing word to heal all 6 brutes. Other than healing, they usually stand back and watch the brutes do the heavy lifting. 
1. [Sahuaguin Priest](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/sahuagin-priestess)

**Brutish Units:**
Every raid group has brute units that simply exist to do hard labor. They are just mindless, obedient fighters that ruthlessly follow commands of their leaders.

# Raid Strategies
The group's primary focus is to abduct targets, focusing on [[Karak-Ulgurath]] demand of bringing librarians and miners to its dominion in [[The Sunken Caverns]]. A party should initially begin a raid with stealth, using a small group of the second in command, a priest, and 6 normal Sahuaguin to start the raid. 

If the forward party encounters resistance, defenses, or difficulty, they call on the secondary forces with a war conch. This conch is always held by the second in commands with a pairing conch held by the primary commander. A signal is blown with 3 long blasts and answered in return with 3 long blasts. 

**Retreat from battle:**
The horns can also be used to sound the retreat signal, which is done if one of the following conditions is met:
1. Both of its heavy siege units have been killed.
2. The leader and second in command have been killed.
3. A leader sees that more than half the force has been killed.
4. The raiding party has abducted all of its primary targets and is ready to leave.

By using 5 strong, short blasts on the horn the raiding party can signal the retreat. Either the commanding Sahuaguin or the second in command will sound this retreat. All members will run back towards the cliff front and attempt to make it down to the sea. They will likely take a round preparing themselves and then jump off the edge and attempt to dive back down.
