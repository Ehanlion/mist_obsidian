# Description
A small, innocuous pond rests amidst a calm grove. No birds tweet, nor frogs croak, nor animals murmur in this calming glen. In the center rests a pool of shimmering, iridescent blue. The waters swirl with enchantment. It does not look deep, but looking closer, this pool has no bottom. Swimming down into the depths, as some have tried, only finds you swimming back up to the surface. Coins and offerings and sprinkled around the edges of the pool.
# Mechanics
A player can make one offering to the pond per week. It can be anything they want. The more value that item has *to the offeror*, the higher chance of something happening. *Something, either good or bad happening.*

A player rolls **a number of percentile die**, at the GM's discretion. A higher-valued offering results in more rolls and a higher success/failure range. At the same time **the GM chooses a good and bad number**. Those numbers should be 1 to 100. The **number of percentile die rolled** equates to the range around those numbers that are considered a "hit." The player picks a number from their rolled numbers. If that number is within the range of the good number GM chose, something good relating to their wish eventually happens or if that number is within range of the bad number GM chose, something bad relating to their wish eventually happens. 

**Lets give an example:**
- A player donates a family heirloom of significant personal value. 
- I, the GM, tell the player to roll 5 times.
- At the same time, not knowing their numbers, I pick two numbers between 1-100. Lets say 50 for good, and 85 for bad.
- The player picks the number 45 from their list.
- Since they rolled 5 dice, the window is +/- 5 from my numbers.
- 45 is within 5 of 50, the good number, so their wish for something good eventually comes true.
- Alternatively, the player chose 84 instead.
- Same idea, the window is +/- 5 from my numbers.
- This time though, they were within 5 of 85, the bad number, so something bad, directly against the wish they made, will eventually happen. 
# Folk Lore
In towns like [[Gullhook]], [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]], or [[Trawlrock]] there are tales of those, down on their luck, that braved [[The High Forests]], searching for a pond in ancient lore that was said to favor the lucky. One man, after his beloved vessel was savaged by the sea, went in search of the pool. When he returned, he sailed his stricken vessel into the sea with confidence and it floated, good as new. Another though, sought out the pool in desperation, for his infant child was deathly ill. He travelled for long nights, found the pond and returned, but when he arrived, his child was dead to plague, alongside his wife.
