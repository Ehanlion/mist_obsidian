# Description:
This is the **Western-Most** sea in the lands of Mist. It lies to the west of both [[The North-West Highlands]] and [[The South-West Arid Expanse]]. It's waves are gentle, its waters calm and placid. The setting sun casts a warm and radiant glow over the waters at sun-down. The fish are plentiful, the sea-creatures tame, and the boats colorful and in bountiful amounts. All in all, its lovely, and a little boring -- not that most sailors would stand to mind that.
