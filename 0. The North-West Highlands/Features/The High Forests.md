Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Near [[Gullhook]], surrounding [[The Echoing Grotto]]
# Description:
A clustering of diverse, wind swept forests atop the [[The North-West Highlands]]. They surround the [[The Echoing Grotto]]. These forests are divided into 5 semi-equal sections. Folk lore has it that the forest was created by 5 gods, some of [[The Prime Deities]] and some of [[The Betrayer Gods]]. 

Of course, this rumor is false. But it was made true, in part, by the people of [[The North-West Highlands]] *believing* that it was true. The forest has 5 sections. They assigned, in belief, 5 gods to it and through generations wrote the folk tale about it.
# The 5 sections:
**To illustrate:** Divide the forest into a rough circle. Each region occupies 1/5th of the pie. Each region is relatively equal in size. Below are each region and a short description. 
### The Untamed Verdant
> The forest associated with [[The Wildmother]]. A lush, vibrant section of the forest. It teems with flora and fauna; a general aura of unpredictable life and charm imbues this area with a sense of hope and wildness. 

**Creatures:**
 - generic creatures of the forest. Only under rare circumstance do other creature venture here. So this region is very safe.
### The Serenity Groves
> The forest associated with [[The Knowing Mentor]]. The trees here are large oaks and willows, their branches graceful and elegant. Wind whispers through the branches and it is said that meditating in these forests can bring helpful or healing visions.

**Creatures:**
- Moon striders
- Elk and deer
- Silver Wolves
### The Glades of Fate
> The forest associated with [[The Matron of Ravens]]. These forests are quite and calm. Petrified trees mix with tall, slender pines. The creatures here move with reverence and it is commonplace to see a raven, watching you as you meander through the forest. Stay long enough and you will see visions of your future. 

**Creatures:**
- Ravens
- [Young Silver Dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17075-young-silver-dragon) - Her name is Sanatoria Starlight, sister to [[Sylvia Starlight]]. She is actually an arch druid that true polymorphed into a silver dragon to explore the worlds. 
### The Charmed Royalties
> The forest associated with [[The Spider Queen]]. Beware the subtle whispers, kind compliments, and invoking whispers in your ears - for these forests run rampant with conniving, telepathic spiders. Large rocks spread out the thick, tall trees here. Dense webs connect trees to trees, scattering the sunlight that peeks through. Many a great warrior have gone missing in these woods, and for good reason. It is said that at its heart, these woods protect a powerful secret and that a great evil runs amuck amidst the trees. 

**The Forest Has Eyes:**
The more you walk in this forest the more that you seem to be watched. The Stone Spider golem can see through the eyes of any spider in the forest and it stalks you. 

**Creatures:**
- Sahuaguin patrol this region of the forest since it is the most westerly. 
- [Phase Spiders](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/phase-spider) - Depict them *trying* to phase shift but failing because of the planar disconnect.
- [Stone Statue Spider](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/prism-spider) - Re-skin prism spider as statue spider. Needs to be baited onto pedestal. 
### The Widow-maker's Stands
> The forest associated with [[The Whispered One]]. Do not go here. No one would dare enter this forest. Death awaits any who walk through the dark thickets here. Heavy mist sits stagnant in the trees here, the sun fears to shine, and adventurers go mad, or if their lucky, they find death here. An adventurer once went in to seek an artifact of resurrection; he never returned. 

**Creatures:**
- Sahuaguin patrol this region of the forest since it is the most westerly. 
- Since this region is the closest to [[The Bay of Kelp]], it is the area where the Sahuaguin are most potent. 
# Hidden Shrines to the Gods:
### [[The Wildmother]]
> A statue of a kneeling women, shrouded in green forest moss stands amidst a placid clearing. Her stone body is covered head to toe with decadent, green mottled moss. Her hand, placed against the ground, sprouts luscious flowers of bright petals and fragrant smells. She seems to be smiling. Around the clearing you see deer, stags, foxes, and animals pawing close to the fringes of the area. Some approach performing various rituals at the statue's base before returning to the forest. 

**Embracing the Shrine:**
If a player follows the behavior of the animals, they can approach and pray to the shrine. They must offer a spoil of the woods and then kneel at the statues feet and pray. 

The following is a table of animals, the actions they do, and the reward a player gets if they replicate it. Once done, the shrine's eyes glow deep green and you feel energy course through you. 

| Animal | Action                                               | Style                  | Reward                                                                                                                                                                        | Lesser Effect                                                                                 |

A creature can only gain these blessings once per year. However, once the blessings fade after a week, lesser but permanent effects still stay. 
### [[The Knowing Mentor]]
> A masked woman stands erect and tall, the back of her statue fused with the thick branch of a towering willow tree. A small stream trickles around the base of the statue as the willow branches lazily hang and scrape the top of the waters. The statue is simple and mostly featureless, wearing a simple gray moss robe draping down from her shoulders. 

**Knowledge is Power:**
Whispering voices urge a creature to approach the shrine, stating the following:

*Riddle:*
"My thirst quenched,
A whisper of guilt,
A fear laid to rest,
A yearning made bare.
Fulfilled I shall be.
Now learn from me and thirst."

If a player approach the shrine and offers up **a guilt**, **a fear**, and **a burning desire**, then they may learn to answer a question that the shrine would know. 
### [[The Matron of Ravens]]
> A women, a stern expression mounted upon her face, gazes reverently out across at you. She stands on the base of a grand petrified tree, surrounded in a glen by tall trees: some petrified, some scarred with fire marks, some healthy. A black bird (raven) perches on her should, where you see draped, a scarf of scarved black feathers, inlayed with black gems. 

**How bout them Ravens eh?**
This shrine is another riddle, a small script is written at the base of the shrine. Each player can be asked a riddle at random from the list. Do this with only one player in the room at a time. The Raven perched on the shoulder telepathically speaks to the creatures mind. 

*Clues:*
Precursors: "Accept my challenge but be forewarned, an answer wrong, a curse unfolds. Answer right, a raven's blessing, on your soul till death's embrace." There are only two riddles, make players leave the room before doing one at a time. 

| Answer                                                                                                                                | Clue                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Asks about fate versus free will. Matron champions Fate and resents free will.                                                        | Upon life's loom, a pattern grows, Is it set by stars, or where the wind blows? Do you tread a path that's set in stone, Or forge your steps, by will alone?      |
| Asks about grieving the fallen and pitying the dead. The matron believes in honoring the dead but not pitying them. Death is natural. | When shadows fall and spirits rise, Do tears honor the ones who meet the skies? Should sorrow grip our hearts so tight, Or do the fallen find peace in the night? |
*Curses and blessings:*
- Curse: "Your fate is sealed." At a crucial moment the raven will curse the player and try to make them fail. This can happen at most once per week but doesn't stop. A player must work to do something that honors [[The Matron of Ravens]].
- Blessing: "Raven's Boon." The protection of the raven gives you a fated life. Once per long rest, when you would drop to 0 hit points, roll a D20 and call odds or evens. On your pick, you instead drop to 1 hit point instead. On a 20, you can regain full hit points, but the blessing fades forever. 
### [[The Spider Queen]]
> A pedestal stands amidst the damp forest. No statue sits on top but markings are clearly present from where one once stood. The pedestal is decorated with gilded, ornately carved webs and eyes. The eyes seem to watch you as you walk around it. The forest surround this area is eerily quiet and the whooshing of winds blows spider webs back and forth, scattering the sunlight as it drifts into the forest. As you stare more, you realize the clearing is ringed with dense rings of spider webs from roots to tree tops. 

**To Find a Rampant-Running Statue:**
This shrine is a sentient, brought-to-life, stone golem. The spider motif that was on the platform is a huge stone spider, gilded in gold and red inlays. It roams the forest. *Make sure it gets seen by adventurers as something shimmering through the woods.* If the golem is baited to walk back on the platform, the magic giving it sentience ends. This magic was casted by [[Ignel Valis]] very recently.

This creature gives off a signature of recently casted magic for detect magic. This creatures gives off necromancy, enchantment, transmutation. 
### [[The Whispered One]]
> A dense shroud of mist covers an open glen. You can catch a glimpse of a faint, stone shrine in the middle but the shifting mists make it hard. Walking into the mists, you lose sight of the shrine. Even walking in a straight lines finds you lost walking out another side of the glade. The grounds surrounding the mist are littered with skeletons and fresh corpses. (If you are lucky enough to see the statue, it is a tall man with gaunt features and a gilded crown with green, swirling gems inlaid into it).

**Special Condition:**
This area is shrouded in magic mist. To walk to the shrine, you must *have only one hit point* and be on death's door. Otherwise, you will walk out the far side. 

**Looting the corpses:**
It is terrible luck to loot the corpses. If you do, gain [[The Whisperer's Curse]] (will force a DC 16 Charisma saving throw, read note for more info).
