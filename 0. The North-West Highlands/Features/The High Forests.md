Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Near [[Gullhook]], surrounding [[The Echoing Grotto]]
# Description:
A clustering of diverse, wind swept forests atop the [[The North-West Highlands]]. They surround the [[The Echoing Grotto]]. These forests are divided into 5 semi-equal sections. Folk lore has it that the forest was created by 5 gods, some of [[The Prime Deities]] and some of [[The Betrayer Gods]]. 

Of course, this rumor is false. But it was made true, in part, by the people of [[The North-West Highlands]] *believing* that it was true. The forest has 5 sections. They assigned, in belief, 5 gods to it and through generations wrote the folk tale about it.
# The 5 sections:
**To illustrate:** Divide the forest into a rough circle. Each region occupies 1/5th of the pie. Each region is relatively equal in size. Below are each region and a short description. 
### The Untamed Verdant
> The forest associated with [[The Wildmother]]. A lush, vibrant section of the forest. It teems with flora and fauna; a general aura of unpredictable life and charm imbues this area with a sense of hope and wildness. 
### The Serenity Groves
> The forest associated with [[The Knowing Mentor]]. The trees here are large oaks and willows, their branches graceful and elegant. Wind whispers through the branches and it is said that meditating in these forests can bring helpful or healing visions.
### The Glades of Fate
> The forest associated with [[The Matron of Ravens]]. These forests are quite and calm. Petrified trees mix with tall, slender pines. The creatures here move with reverence and it is commonplace to see a raven, watching you as you meander through the forest. Stay long enough and you will see visions of your future. 
### The Charmed Royalties
> The forest associated with [[The Spider Queen]]. Beware the subtle whispers, kind compliments, and invoking whispers in your ears - for these forests run rampant with conniving, telepathic spiders. Large rocks spread out the thick, tall trees here. Dense webs connect trees to trees, scattering the sunlight that peeks through. Many a great warrior have gone missing in these woods, and for good reason. It is said that at its heart, these woods protect a powerful secret.
### The Widow-maker's Stands
> The forest associated with [[The Whispered One]]. Do not go here. No one would dare enter this forest. Death awaits any who walk through the dark thickets here. Heavy mist sits stagnant in the trees here, the sun fears to shine, and adventurers go mad, or if their lucky, they find death here. An adventurer once went in to seek an artifact of resurrection; he never returned.
