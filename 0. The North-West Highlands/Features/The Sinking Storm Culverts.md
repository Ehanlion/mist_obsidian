# True Nature: (Hide from Players)
The true nature of the Culverts are that they in fact are NOT culverts or storm drains, but rather chimneys. They can be dated to the same time of [[The Obelisk Field]]'s stone makeup and as such, they are an ancient relic of [[The Many]]. While now their tops barely poke above the surface of the oceans, when they were built they would act as chimneys for an underground complex built under [[The North-West Highlands]].
