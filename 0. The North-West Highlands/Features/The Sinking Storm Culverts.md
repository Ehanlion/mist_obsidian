Regional Location: [[The North-West Highlands]]
Subsection: Along coast, near where [[The Obelisk Field]] is (same stretch of coast that both are along).
# Description:
If you look hard enough, strolling atop the great white cliffs of [[The North-West Highlands]] or as you sail into the waters nearest to the cliffs, maybe you will see a glint of metal sunk beneath the waves. At points along the cliffs, there are large, cylindrical, metal shafts with fine metal mesh grates covering the top. Many are encrusted with coral, barnacles, and seaweed, but if you look close enough, they are there. 

If you gaze down into the grated top of these, darkness unfolds below. Only swimming into it would reveal what exists down there, and that's a tall order: the grates are decidedly difficult to break. One thing is for certain, it feels like water either gets pulled in or pushed out of these object (only on or the other, depending on the location). 
# True Nature: (Hide from Players)
The culverts used to draw in fresh air for compounds built be [[The Many]]. However, the seas rose in the time since they reigned and have covered up the culverts, filling the compounds (partially) with sea water.
