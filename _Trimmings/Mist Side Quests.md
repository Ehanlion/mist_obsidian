# Formatting Side Quests
I want to keep this *very* well organized because it will track mini and even big side quest ideas throughout the entirety of campaign. This section will breakdown a good metric for organizing these mission, how to address them once run, an indicator of which session the mission was run during, and outcomes.

# Storage for Side Quest Ideas
### Old List from  [[Quest to Chase the Raiders]]
**Cool hooks or ideas to seed in town:**
- [ ] Glimpses of Sahuaguin to high passive perception, tracking leads back to salvage yard. Some Sahuaguin are spying on the town. 
- [x] Tax collector needs help with labor to go collect taxes, except everyone who is getting taxes collected should be getting a break from them since they lost loved one in the raids
	- [x] make this discoverable be like "oh I already paid, I thought I was getting a break"
	- [x] Have them work with crooked guards? 
- [ ] Igor and Dmitri were here, Dmitri went off to visit Livy's Livestock. Igor is in town still. Hear about this from a random tavern, maybe Chugga's or the brothel, love makes its way. 
	- [ ] This would be for Wake specifically, if they ask around have people refer them to bars or brothel or something idk
	- [ ] Arnov has seen them the day he is asked about it
	- [ ] They are actually in temple glade with Tennyson
- [ ] Monsters hunters needed in the Guildhall, group can choose to abandon their quest and go monster hunting instead.
	- Crews are here from island towns of:
		- [ ] [[The Port of Last Call]] - further east than other island towns
		- [ ] [[The Town of Newhaven]] - icy, cold town surrounded with icebergs far north
		- [ ] [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]] - right near [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]
- [ ] Deion can meet some old friends from [[Gandoras City]] at the Trading Post, since this is where the caravans pass through. Caravans have been having a rough time, the one currently in town is the last one since [[Gandoras City]] and the Trade Guild are shutting them down due to violence. 
	- [ ] good lead in for tales of happenings in widow makers stands or charmer royalties
	- [ ] Maybe have them recount sighting of Sahuaguin, which they thought was weird. 
- [ ] Rock-tenders need help levitating a ship, good chance for Kelswin to learn magic but not magic? 
	- [ ] Pitch this like a rock tender job opening is available
	- [ ] willing to train but must show magic ability
- [ ] Ship repair for a damaged pirate ship that sailed into town. Needs someone to help repair hull
	- [ ] Great way to learn about seas and  danged
	- [ ] Lots of knowledge about shrouds mist oceans etc.
- [ ] Help "Fishermen" (actually pirates) unload their "catch" (expensive, illicit goods) into town
	- [ ] Discrete, good face mission
	- [ ] Need to get goods off ship and smuggle them to a seller in town willing to pay mule fee
- [ ] The Other Way and [[Arnov Vasilov]] can help with the Mind Rock and some info about that. He can tell tales about the South east coast? Maybe allude to [[Ignel Valis]] as Sylvan Gile here? Just say like, oh powerful magic, knew a wizard from the coast who did that, name was Sylvan, Sylvan Gile or something.
	- [ ] good way to seed that SG is after powerful artifacts since maybe Arnov helped him?
	- [ ] DO NOT include a connection to NW because that would be leading towards SG = IV 
- [x] People going missing in town, specifically those who have already lost loved ones. Connected to [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]] who are abducting people and sending them to [[Livy's Livestock]]. This connect to [[Dmitri Mironov]], who is gone from [[Gullhook]] because he is taking some abductees to [[Livy's Livestock]] and [[Igor Larionov]] who is helping but is hiding out in [[Gullhook]]. 
	- [x] [[Igor Larionov]] and [[Dmitri Mironov]] are helping because the slaves get shipped back to [[Fedorov's Legion]] or to [[The Sunken Caverns]] for [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], as per [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] orders. 
- [ ] Potion maker from Dozy Brewer's needs help getting ingredients from market 
	- [ ] hunt for specific alchemic ingredients and acquire them to get paid out
	- [ ] Also a change to learn bout potion brewing. 
	- [ ] Learn to use an alchemists, herbalists, or whatever kit or something 
- [ ] Brute and enforcer of private hand needed for sparring practice
	- [ ] Basically someone goes to be an expert dueler's target dummy?
# Basic Guidance for New Quests

> [!NOTE] Notes on Side Quests from Players
> The biggest takeaway for side quests is that solo side questing, where players end up all feeling like they are forced to split up to get value, is not great. If you are going to create a side quest, make sure it has appeal to the *entire* party and not just one player. This way, *the entire party* feels like they can join in on just one quest. The rewards should be adjusted for this.
> 
> Say for instance, there are 4 small quests that pay out 1000 gp each, and one massive quest that appeals to everyone but pays 1500 gp. It is the player's nature to say "Hey, if we split, we can do 4 quests and get way more money, let's just do that."
> 
> There is even *another layer* to this whole debacle. Lets say the GM plans 4 *bigger* quests, that each pay now 5000 gp to give the group diversity on what mission to select. There is an issue here: it is likely that the players will say "hey we can, again, just do four bigger quests and get even more gold." Even if the players *vocally tell me they want bigger quests* they will, of course, take the opportunity to stack up as much gold as possible. 
> 
> It needs to be *very apparent* that a large quest demands a full party to journey on it; from a simple posting that says "four required for task X," to "large crew needed to audition for task Y," or simply "this quest is very dangerous, take your friends or you will die."

# Side Quest List
#### To Hunt a Baby Kraken - **UNUSED** - `UNFINISHED`
- [ ] Check to indicated if the quest has been completed
- **Session first used in:**
- **Location used in:** 
> [!NOTE] Quest Hook - Mission Posting Variant
> **Wanted: Brave Souls to Hunt a Young Terror of the Deep**
>
A baby kraken has been wreaking havoc in the waters of [[The Distant Sea]], leaving destroyed ships and shattered lives in its wake. Two brave and desperate souls seek assistance in confronting this monstrous threat:
>
>1. **The Honorable Fisherman:** Seeking revenge for the destruction of his friend’s ship, this fisherman offers nothing but the thrill of the hunt and a ship to carry you to the kraken’s lair. There is no gold reward—only the promise of excitement and the satisfaction of avenging the lost.
  >  
>2. **The Wealthy Collector:** A collector of rare sea-beast artifacts desires the beak of a baby kraken to add to his collection. He offers a reward of 1000 gold pieces for its retrieval but cannot provide a ship or means to locate the beast.
>
The kraken’s exact location remains unknown, but clues to its whereabouts and habits can be found among the seaside towns and island settlements of [[The Distant Sea]]. Those with courage and skill, ready to face the terror of the deep, should inquire within. The hunt awaits.
- Secondary Quest Hook alternative
> [!NOTE] Quest Hook - Conversation Variant
> "You hear about that baby kraken out in [[The Distant Sea]]?" one grizzled adventurer says, leaning over his mug of ale. His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper, drawing the attention of the others at the table. "A fisherman down by the docks is looking to avenge his friend, whose ship got torn apart by the thing. He’s got a boat and a fire in his belly but no clue where to find the beast. No gold in it, just the thrill of the chase."
>
Another adventurer, a sharp-eyed rogue, chimes in, "Yeah, but if you’re after coin, there’s this rich guy—some collector with a thing for sea-beasts. He’s offering a thousand gold for the kraken’s beak, though he’s not helping with the search. Just imagine, a thousand gold in your pocket if you can track it down and bring back the proof!"
>
The table falls quiet for a moment, the weight of the challenge settling in. "The thing is," the grizzled one continues, "nobody knows exactly where it is, but they say it hunts near islands, and the seas start to smell like sulfur when it’s close. Sounds like we’d have to do some digging around the local towns, maybe [[The Port of Last Call]] or [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]], to pick up its trail. But hell, wouldn’t that be a story to tell?"

- **Quest Description and Information:**
	- *Clues available for the hunt:*
		- It is important that for this Quest, players need to find clues about how to hunt a baby kraken in order to succeed. Else they run the risk of sailing unguided into the seas. 
		- The following is a list of potential clues that the party could get to either help them locate the baby kraken or bait it to attack them.
			1. A Kraken's favorite food is rotting whale blubber. A kraken is sure to hunt with vigor if it can smell it. 
			2. A Kraken can detect scent in the water for a range of 10 miles, giving it a highly precise way of hunting.
			3. A Kraken loves to hunt near islands but hates coral reefs. 
			4. The seas near a Kraken are said to smell sulphiric and metallic when a Kraken is within half of a mile. This can be hinted at to players by describing the sea changing aroma to 'like rotting eggs' or 'like the scent of an unoiled blade.'
	- *Best Locations to search for information:* 
		- Towns by the sea - rumors and myths surrounding the kraken
			- Search by towns far removed from hunting from the deep parts of the seas would give clues as part of myths or stories rather than as actual, factual clues
			- When giving clues in this sense, reference the clues available for this hunt section above and change one aspect of the clue whenever recounting it within a myth or story. 
			- Remember, these stories are legends, not a treatise on the kraken haha. 
		- Island towns - specific information and well known facts
			- Island towns are in harsher, more desperate environments, exposed to much greater danger compares to sea-side towns. As a result, these towns know much more concrete information regarding sea creatures, monsters, and in this case, Kraken.
			- The following towns are a great starting place to use for this Quest:
				- [[The Port of Last Call]] - Town far to the North and West in [[The Distant Sea]], last point of civilization before reaching the confluence of the Northern and Western walls of mist, apart of [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]. 
				- [[The Town of Newhaven]] - Town on multiple, rocky, perilously-tall islands slightly south of [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]]. 
				- [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]] - Town on a large island near the [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]] towards the north of [[The Distant Sea]]

>
A reward of 100 gold pieces per head is offered to any brave soul or band of adventurers willing to investigate and eliminate these lurking threats.

>
To accept this quest, first report to the Guild-Master in the Guildhall to get a contract, then report to Foreman Gideon Rusthand at the Salvage Yards for more details and guidance. Your courage and skill are needed to ensure the safety of Gullhook and put an end to this mysterious menace.

### Gideon Southmellow
Gideon assigned the group the quest. He can be found at the entrance to the Salvage Yards. 
#### Who is Gideon
*Gideon Southmellow:* Gideon is a portly, larger bugbear with a husky voice. He has a small office (decorated with old memorabilia and mystery-hunting info and postings) and home that occupies the remains of an old ship - his old ship - called fog scythe.
- Gideon was a pirate captain
- Gideon led "Mist Plunges," sailing missions into the Mist (to little success)
	- Gideon's ship was badly injured and scuttled in [[Gullhook]] after a storm. He took over The Salvage Yards as a result. 
	- Gideon is a kook: he loves mysteries and the unknown, but has a bad memory. He has a book called his charter book about mysteries of the Hidden Forests
		- It contains info about the lore of the [[The Revitalizing Spring]] and [[The Wishing Pond]]
		- It contains reference to "shrines of the 5 founding gods" meaning [[The Wildmother]], [[The Knowing Mentor]], [[The Matron of Ravens]], [[The Spider Queen]], and [[The Whispered One]].
- Gideon is forgetful and a little batty
- Gideon is VERY paranoid now with the interlopers on his property 
- Gideon is injured, was attacked while walking the yards at night "by something that squidges and squelches around" He tried to run away, got trapped in a net, and his charter of mysteries was taken from him then. 
### The Sahuaguin Enemy
#### Details About the Enemy
The Sahuagin Interlopers are cunning and ruthless, employing a variety of deadly traps to protect their hideout and eliminate any intruders. Their tactics reflect their underwater origins, but they've adapted remarkably well to the labyrinthine environment of the Salvage Yards. They are spies in the town, gathering information about raider targets, potential threats, and groups hot on their trail. 
#### Creatures to Use
**The Sahuaguin Interloper Party:**
- 1x blade master (use saltmarsh)
- 1x priestess (use saltmarsh)
- 5x Sahuaguin brutes (use monster manual)
#### Traps and Tactics
**Tactics:** The Sahuagin Interlopers are well-coordinated, using the chaotic environment of the Salvage Yards to their advantage. They rely on hit-and-run tactics, using their traps to weaken and disorient intruders before moving in for the kill. The Blade Master, a seasoned warrior, leads the charge, directing the brutes in strategic strikes. Meanwhile, the Priestess uses her dark magic to curse and confuse their enemies from afar. 

**Hiding Spots are Key:** The Sahuagin make use of the many hiding spots within the yards, attacking from unexpected angles and retreating into the shadows when faced with strong resistance. They communicate using guttural clicks and whistles, almost inaudible to human ears, ensuring that they can coordinate their attacks without revealing their positions.

**Kiting and Group Attack:** They will attack a group, but will seek to lure them away and into an area that they trapped and prepared before hand to defend. They know that an attack is likely, so this makes sense. 

**Traps:**
1. **Nets and Tripwires**: The Sahuagin have strategically placed nearly invisible nets woven from seaweed and sturdy fibers across narrow pathways. These nets are rigged to tripwires, which, when triggered, cause the net to spring up and entangle unsuspecting adventurers. The nets are coated in a slick, oily substance that makes escape difficult and leaves those trapped vulnerable to attacks.    
2. **Oil Flasks and Fire Traps**: Hidden among the debris are flasks of oil carefully placed to spill when disturbed. Tripwires are attached to these flasks, and when triggered, the oil spreads quickly across the ground. The Sahuagin have set up torches and flint traps that can ignite the oil, creating a sudden blaze. They may also use fire arrows or flaming crossbow bolts to ignite the oil remotely, cutting off escape routes or forcing their enemies into more dangerous areas.    
3. **Poisoned Crossbows and Tripwire Triggers**: Crossbows are hidden within piles of wreckage, aimed at choke points and passageways. These crossbows are rigged to tripwires, and when triggered, they fire bolts laced with paralytic poison. The poison is fast-acting, designed to slow down or incapacitate intruders, making them easy prey for the Sahuagin.    
4. **Fall Traps**: The Sahuagin have set up false floors and weak planks across key areas of the Salvage Yards. These areas are rigged to collapse under weight, dropping intruders into pits filled with jagged metal, splintered wood, or even waiting Sahuagin brutes. The traps are often disguised with a thin layer of debris, making them difficult to spot until it's too late.    
5. **Swinging Wreckage**: Using their strength and knowledge of the yards, the Sahuagin have rigged massive chunks of wreckage—like old ship masts or anchors—on ropes and pulleys. These are set to swing down from above when a tripwire is triggered, crushing anything in their path. The Sahuagin may also release these traps manually from hidden vantage points, timing their attacks to cause maximum damage.
6. **Eel Blasting Jelly**: There are some kegs of blasting jelly littered in strategic spots, usually in old ship wreckage or near ships frames that are bound to fall over. These do massive damage, and require a dexterity save. They are ignited with a flaming bolt or general fire. 
#### Sahuaguin Hideout
**Location**: The Sahuagin hideout is cleverly concealed within the deepest, most treacherous part of the Salvage Yards, known as the "Wrecked Maw." This area is a tangled mess of ship hulls, rusted chains, and broken masts, creating a natural maze of debris. The entrance to the hideout is hidden beneath a large, barnacle-encrusted anchor that appears to be just another piece of forgotten wreckage.
**Entrance**: To access the hideout, the Sahuagin lift the anchor—using a pulley system they've rigged—and slip through a narrow opening beneath it. The entrance leads into a submerged tunnel that extends into the heart of their lair. This tunnel is filled with seawater, providing the Sahuagin with a strategic advantage as they can move through it quickly while most intruders will struggle to navigate or even breathe in the confined space.
**Main Chamber**: The main chamber of the hideout is an open area within the belly of an ancient shipwreck. The walls are lined with stolen treasures and trinkets, trophies of the Sahuagin’s past raids. A large pool of seawater dominates the center, providing the Sahuagin with a means of escape if needed. The Blade Master’s quarters are located here, along with a small shrine to their dark god, where the Priestess performs her rituals.
**Ambush Points**: Around the main chamber, the Sahuagin have set up several ambush points, including elevated perches made from stacked crates and debris, where brutes can rain down attacks from above. These perches also serve as lookouts, giving the Sahuagin an early warning system against intruders.
**Escape Routes**: The hideout features multiple escape routes, including narrow tunnels leading out to various points in the Salvage Yards. These tunnels are well hidden and can be collapsed in an emergency, sealing off the Sahuagin's retreat and trapping any pursuers.
**Defensive Measures**: The entrance to the hideout is heavily guarded by traps and sentries. The Sahuagin have also trained several of the Salvage Yard’s native creatures—such as the Rustmonger Crabs and Scuttleweavers—to patrol the area, adding another layer of defense against intruders.
**Prisoner Cages**: This is optional! If you wish to add [[The Followers of Alsolace]] visiting, include multiple children in cages, Alice can be one of them. They are trapped and if listened to, it appears the Sahuaguin priestess negotiates with [[The Followers of Alsolace]]. 

This hideout serves as a well-fortified base for the Sahuagin, allowing them to spy on the town while remaining hidden and protected by the chaos of the Salvage Yards.
#### Double Dealing
**[[The Followers of Alsolace]]**:
The followers work with either [[Livy's Livestock]] or [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], in this case the Sahaguin, to trade slaves for gold. The followers want gold, the Sahuaguin want workers and Livy's wants slaves. They do business with both. Both [[Livy's Livestock]] and [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] tie directly back to [[Fedorov's Legion]]. You can introduce [[Igor Larionov]] who works with [[Fedorov's Legion]] as apart of this. 

**Meetings:** The Sahuaguin do not work alone. For information and capturing additional slaves, the Sahuaguin provide [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]] with gold and precious goods that they have stole from town. They have short meetings with [[Tennyson Heralds]] while Temple Guards stand watch and lookout over the Salvage Yards. Sometimes general followers will do these deals instead. If the guards are asked about the nature of the meeting, or what they are doing in the yards, they simply say they were looking to go for a nice stroll, which is deliberately total bullshit. 

It would be great to show [[The Followers of Alsolace]] bringing in some children secretly, in exchange for a deal. Make sure there is a way for the group to stalk these guys. If they are encounter, they split up and try to run to find the meeting spot unseen. 

This could also be a good place to introduce [[Igor Larionov]], a target of [[Wake Tiraus]]. He could show up to explore the wreckage to meet with the Sahuaguin or as a part of [[Tennyson Heralds]] group since he works with them, as a correspondent from [[Fedorov's Legion]]. 

**Capturing Children:** Since the group works with [[Tennyson Heralds]], they target vulnerable children to capture in town, specifically ones of parents that seem a little too eager to explore [[The High Forests]]. These children are taken to the Temple Glade in [[Gullhook]] and then given, as per an agreement with [[Fedorov's Legion]], to [[Livy's Livestock]] to be brainwashed and transported to [[The Stormlocked Frontier]] via [[The Bloodstone Pass]].  
## A Funeral for an Enemy
### Location and Setup
**Session First Used In:** ???
**Location Used In:** [[Gullhook]], specifically Temple Glade
*Suggested Location Ideas:* Temple Glade in [[Gullhook]]
### Rewards
1. **Information and Allies:**  
    Players who successfully expose [[Tennyson Heralds]] may gain valuable information about [[Fedorov's Legion]] and its operations. They might also earn the gratitude and support of those who were deceived by [[Tennyson Heralds]], gaining new allies in the region.
2. **Treasure:**  
    If the players uncover hidden caches of gold intended as tribute to [[Alsolace]], they could claim these riches for themselves. Additionally, they may find rare religious artifacts within Temple Glade, some of which could hold genuine power despite the false nature of [[Alsolace]].
3. **Divine Favor:**  
    Depending on how the players handle the situation, they might earn the favor of one of the true gods, who see the restoration of their worship as a righteous act. This could manifest as divine blessings, boons, or even a powerful relic.
### Description
> [!NOTE] Quest Hook
> In the heart of town, a prominent notice catches the eye, detailing an upcoming grand funeral to honor the memory of a 'dear friend of [[Tennyson Heralds]],' the esteemed [[Dmitri Mironov]]. The ceremony, dedicated to the golden god [[Alsolace]], will take place in the sacred Temple Glade at sundown tomorrow. [[Dmitri Mironov]] is depicted as a figure of immense importance within the temple, a pillar of the religious community, tragically cut down by a fearsome entity known as the "Wraith of the Night." This malevolent being, described as a shifting, shadowy figure armed with scything steel blades, is said to serve the mysterious dark god [[Erstorndin]]. According to the details, [[Tennyson Heralds]] warns that the "Wraith of the Night" can only be vanquished by the golden power of [[Alsolace]]. To this end, he urges the faithful to make gold donations at [[Alsolace]]'s shrine in Temple Glade, so that the god might be empowered to defeat this dark threat.
>
> The posting invites all who wish to pay their respects to [[Dmitri Mironov]], a revered member of [[The Followers of Alsolace]], the guardians of Temple Glade and its sacred rites. Attendees are asked to don the traditional white and gold hooded robes as a sign of reverence and solidarity with the holy practices of the temple.

### Possible Objectives
1. **Attend the Funeral (Optional):**  
    The group can choose to attend the funeral in Temple Glade to gather more information and observe the proceedings. They must don the traditional white and gold hooded robes to blend in and avoid drawing suspicion. During the ceremony, they can listen to [[Tennyson Heralds]]’s speech, observe the reactions of the townsfolk, and possibly spot any irregularities or signs of further deception.    
2. **Investigate [[Tennyson Heralds]]’s Plan:**  
    Knowing that [[Tennyson Heralds]] is up to no good, the group can investigate his true motives. This might involve discreetly speaking to townsfolk who have been hurt by the increasing demands for gold offerings, searching [[Tennyson Heralds]]’s private quarters in the temple for incriminating evidence, or tracking the flow of gold to see if it is being funneled elsewhere—likely towards their dark dealings with [[Livy's Livestock]].
3. **Confront [[Tennyson Heralds]]:** If the group uncovers enough evidence or decides that they have seen enough, they can confront [[Tennyson Heralds]] either during or after the funeral. They may choose to expose his deception to the assembled crowd, revealing the truth about [[Alsolace]] and the fabricated threats posed by [[Erstorndin]]. This confrontation could lead to a dramatic showdown, either verbally or physically, depending on how [[Tennyson Heralds]] and his followers react.
4. **Disrupt the Ceremony (Optional):** If the group believes that the funeral is merely a cover for more of [[Tennyson Heralds]]’s schemes, they might choose to disrupt the ceremony itself. This could involve sabotaging the shrine of [[Alsolace]], secretly turning the crowd against [[Tennyson Heralds]], or even revealing the truth about [[Dmitri Mironov]]'s death. They might find unexpected allies among the attendees who have also begun to doubt the cult’s teachings.
5. **Expose [[Tennyson Heralds]]’s Deception:**  
    The ultimate goal is to expose [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]] as frauds, bringing the truth to light and putting an end to their schemes. This might involve publicizing the truth in [[Gullhook]], rallying the townsfolk against [[Tennyson Heralds]], or turning key followers of [[Alsolace]] against him. The group may also choose to expose the dark connections between the cult and [[Fedorov's Legion]], as well as their involvement in the slave trade with [[Livy's Livestock]]
### Possible Outcomes
1. **Successful Exposure:**  
    If the group successfully exposes [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[Alsolace]] as frauds, [[The Followers of Alsolace]] will be thrown into disarray. The townsfolk of [[Gullhook]] might rise against [[Tennyson Heralds]], leading to his downfall or escape. Temple Glade could return to its original purpose as a place of worship for the true gods, or it could fall into ruin as the faith of the people crumbles. The exposure of the slave trade might lead to further conflicts with [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[Livy's Livestock]].    
2. **Failed Confrontation:**  
    If the group is unable to gather enough evidence or is outmatched by [[Tennyson Heralds]] and his followers, they may be forced to flee or fight their way out of Temple Glade. [[Tennyson Heralds]] could use this opportunity to solidify his power, painting the group as enemies of the faith and further manipulating the people of [[Gullhook]]. This failure might strengthen [[Fedorov's Legion]]'s influence in the region and solidify the slave trade operation.    
3. **Silent Sabotage:**  
    The group may choose to undermine [[Tennyson Heralds]]'s power subtly, without directly confronting him during the funeral. They might spread doubt among his followers, disrupt the ceremony in small but significant ways, or secretly turn the townsfolk against him. This approach could lead to a slower, more drawn-out conflict, but it could ultimately weaken [[Tennyson Heralds]]'s control over the region and potentially expose the cult’s criminal activities.
### The Funeral Itself

> [!NOTE] The Funeral Description
> As twilight descends upon Gullhook, the sacred grounds of Temple Glade are transformed into a grand stage for one of the most elaborate ceremonies the town has ever seen. A vast crowd gathers in the quadrangle, a wide, open space at the heart of the glade, surrounded by the imposing natural beauty of the rocky cliffs and the calm waters of the lake. The air is thick with a mix of incense and the murmurs of the assembled townsfolk, all eyes fixed on the centerpiece of the ceremony: a towering statue of [[Alsolace]], the golden god.
>
The statue, which dominates the glade, is a sight to behold. Appearing to be made of pure gold, it gleams brilliantly in the fading light of the day, casting long shadows across the crowd. Its radiant surface reflects the last rays of the setting sun, creating an almost divine halo around it. The townspeople believe this statue to be the ultimate symbol of their faith, a testament to the power of their god and the protection he offers against the encroaching darkness.
>
The funeral procession, led by [[Tennyson Heralds]] and flanked by [[The Followers of Alsolace]], moves solemnly through the quadrangle towards the statue. The crowd is dressed in white and gold robes, the traditional garb for such ceremonies, their faces a mix of grief and reverence as they watch the proceedings unfold. The atmosphere is one of heavy solemnity, the quiet only broken by the soft music played by hidden musicians and the occasional toll of a distant bell.
### Sinister things in the Glade
#### Statue to Alsolace
**The Statue:**  In reality, the statue is nothing more than a wooden structure, hastily covered in cheap gold foil to deceive the faithful and maintain the illusion of [[Alsolace]]’s power. 
#### The Children are Missing
**The Ceremony is a Cover:** Beneath the surface of this carefully orchestrated ceremony, however, lies a dark and insidious purpose. Unbeknownst to the gathered townsfolk, children attending the ceremony are being quietly abducted by [[The Followers of Alsolace]], taken to hidden passages within Temple Glade where they will be spirited away to [[Livy's Livestock]]. As [[Tennyson Heralds]] delivers his impassioned speech, the true horror of the event goes unnoticed, cloaked in the false light of [[Alsolace]]’s supposed benevolence.
#### Devotees Diving in the Crocodile Infested Lake
