Subsection: Brainstormed Custom Pantheon for [[Mist]]

*This was originally a note that I had on my mobile device which I deleted, cause I'm awesome ...*

**The Five:**
- I am creating this to supplant the normal pantheons of [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]]. I know that my players barely know any of the gods, not even their own. Yes Sean, that is you not remember the name of [[The Dawnfather]]. That's okay.
- This pantheon would reduce the number of gods down to just 5 (ish) and increase their breadth of effect. By that I mean each god would be wider spread and more widely interpreted by those who follow them.
- We can break the gods down like this:
	- One good god, the champion of light
	- One evil god, the harbinger of dark 
	- Three gods in the middle
		- Left of middle is a healer women of the woods kind of god
		- Right of the middle is a liar, deceitful god of tricksters and gamblers
		- Center of the middle is the god of law and order and courts
