**Basics**
- No god may step into [[Mist]] or communicate with it in any way
- [[Mist]] is known and remember by both [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]] (it is also viscerally hated by both groups)
- [[The Divine Barrier]] blocks the gods from reaching [[Mist]] in any capacity
- Divine magic in [[Mist]] is *fabricated* from the powers of [[The Mist Codex]]
- Visions, divine interventions, and any interactions in dream or the likes are *manufactured* by [[The Mist Codex]]
- Some older statues have residue of true divine magic, once conduits for ancient divine power, these now operate under control of [[The Mist Codex]]
- If [[The Mist Codex]] de-activates, all of divine magic *instantly ceases* (Paladins, Clerics)
- The true nature of [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]] are *vastly different* to the manufactured visages

Clerics and Paladins (as well as ancillaries who draw from divinities for magic and power) still function as in normal D&D. However, the true nature of the magic imbued into those who draw it is vastly different than normal. It relies on a *programmed illusion* of [[The Mist Codex]] artificially replicating programmed memories of both [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]]. This programming was done by [[The Many]], specifically [[Sprague]] ([[The Many]]'s master of the divine).
