Subsection: Rulings on the divine in Mist
# The Gods of Mist
Mist is a land of high magic and greatness. For thousands of years the divine has had a hand in the workings of Mist. Before the arrival of [[The Many]], the primal beings of Mist worshipped what are now called [[The Old Gods]]. These are derelict, unknown, and widely forgotten gods that have no dominion nor influence in Mist. The only known survivor of [[The Old Gods]] is [[Grumbar]], whose soul is sealed and his essence trapped on Mist still. Now Mist follows [[The Pantheon of Mist]], consisting of [[The Prime Deities]] (powerful, good-aligned Gods), [[The Betrayer Gods]] (turned, evil-aligned Gods), and other miscellaneous deities. 
### Separated from Mist:
[[The Prime Deities]], [[The Betrayer Gods]], and other deities like [[The Storm Lord]] cannot have a physical or mental connection to Mist thanks to [[The Divine Barrier]], powered from [[The Mist Codex]]. *Beliefs of these gods are maintained through passed down tradition and powers are derived from the **belief** that these gods really still exist.* They don't and have not for eons, but it is the belief that keeps their connections alive. Think like the Greek gods from Percy Jackson: they would fade if no one prayed or upheld their part of the Greek mythos.
