Regional Location: Event in [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]
Subsection: [[Mount Starlight]] in [[The Starwoods]]
# Description:
Every 100 years, the moon called [[Amides]] perfectly aligns with the peak of [[Mount Starlight]]. When this happens, the lunar energy flows into the stone of [[Mount Starlight]] via a temple at the peak of the mountain. The mountain glows with faint light and the power from [[Amides]] seeps into the lands of [[The Starwoods]]. The event empowers anyone influenced by [[The Prime Deities]]. 
# Disrupting the Resurgence:
It is actually very easy to disrupt the resurgence. Since the lunar energy from [[Amides]] seeps into [[Mount Starlight]] via a temple at the peak of [[Mount Starlight]], it is possible to deny the lunar energy from melding with [[Mount Starlight]] by simply placing a mirror in the middle of the temple. The lunar energy is concentrated withing a 10 feet by 10 feet area of sacred ground which is where the mirror could be placed. 

If this happens, [[The Starwoods]] begin to wilt and die. All casters that are apart of [[The Green Order]] draw their energy from [[Amides]] and [[The Starwoods]] themselves so if the resurgence is disrupted, their powers begin to fade gradually. 
# Mechanics of the Buff:
All creatures that draw their power from a connection with one of [[The Prime Deities]] is empowered under the light of [[Amides]] and The Clean Moon.

Any instance of damage dealt by creatures with influence from [[The Prime Deities]] increased by 1d12 of radiant damage as the moon purifies and empowers their strikes. Casters can cast a number of spells equal to their proficiency bonus without expending a spell slot as the moon augments their magic. Martial characters are able to attack once extra per attack action as the moon imbues them with swiftness.
