**On the way to [[Karak-Ulgurath]]**
We need to make the following key points perfectly clear
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is NOT a god and CAN be defeated
- There are CLEAR mechanisms in place to disempower [[Karak-Ulgurath]] from its "divine" connection
	- destroying the shrine to [[The Stormlord]]
	- breaking the enchantment on the shrine to [[The Stormlord]]
- There is a clear REASON for the creation of [[Karak-Ulgurath]]
	- Mechanism of [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]'s plans
	- Aspect of [[The Stormlord]] ([[Karak-Ulgurath]]) rises every 500 years and proclaims a prophecy for [[The Aquan Nations]] to follow
	- It is a powerful siege monster and can be against [[Gandoras City]]
- These is a clear REASON to KILL [[Karak-Ulgurath]]
	- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is bound to a [[Master Mind Rock]], controlling the normal [[Mind Rock]]s
	- These are embedded on every Mind Rock Crab that has been created
	- But also onto the Librarians ([[Vivian Lovejoy]])
	- This allows them to be controlled and their memories accessed freely by [[Silvan Gile]]
	- Destroying the shrine to [[The Stormlord]] breaks [[Karak-Ulgurath]]'s powers
	- Destroying the [[Master Mind Rock]] breaks the hold over all normal [[Mind Rock]]s
	- Destroying [[Karak-Ulgurath]] stops it from being used as a siege weapon later
- These is a clear UNDERSTANDING on what happens with [[The Aquan Nations]] if [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is defeated
	- [[The Aquan Nations]] were given a prophecy by [[Karak-Ulgurath]]
	- The prophecy demands that [[The Aquan Nations]] lead a war against [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] to claim it as their own dominion
	- They will operate with or without it physically being there to guide them
	- [[The Aquan Nations]] have their own leadership to lead them
	- The prophecy shapes the next 500 years and cannot be ignored 
	- The only way to overcome the prophecy is to make it far too costly for [[The Aquan Nations]] and offer them concessions
		- War lead by [[Gandoras City]] against them
		- Grant them lands of their own on [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] to make peace with their prophecy
