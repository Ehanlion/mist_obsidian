**What Act 1 Does:**
In [[Act 1 Plot Plans]], we detail how the first act will do the following:
- Introduce enemy characters and factions
- Establish the group and an ongoing conflict in the world
- Bring into focus the northern factions of [[Mist]] and antagonists of Mist
	- [[Fedorov's Legion]] with [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and [[Silvan Gile]]
	- [[The Followers of Alsolace]] and [[Tennyson Heralds]]
	- [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] and [[Garrick Blackthorn]]
	- [[The Umbral Cabal]] and their Devil leaders
	- [[The Aquan Nations]] and [[Karak-Ulgurath]]
- Establish conflict in [[The Whitecliff Plateau]], centered on [[Gandoras City]]
	- [[The Seat of Stone]] leads [[Gandoras City]], lead by [[King Hyranthara]]
	- Advised by [[The Blackwood Ring]], [[The Ring of Wealth]], and [[The Weaver's Ring]]
	- The efforts here should establish a war in the region

**Introducing [[The Many]]**
- It is important to introduce the *idea* of [[The Many]]
- They do not have to be named outright, but can be referred to as the following:
	- *The Ancients* - refers to their age and longevity 
	- *The Founder* - refers to their establishing of regions and features
	- *The Defenders* - allude to their conflicts and battles
	- *The First of Mist* - refers to their influence on early [[Mist]]
	- *The Architects* - refers to their creations and structures
	- *The Vengeful Ones* - refers to their original act and obsession with protection
	- Each name tells a tale of those who believe it. Different peoples have different beliefs about the founders of [[Mist]] and who [[The Many]]. Not one is correct, but rather a myriad of all of the collective tales will tell the full story. These are best paired with some *monument* to associate the title with.
- [[The Many]] are associated directly with *ancient architecture*
	- It is important to make this association
	- The following should all be repeatedly described to be "Of the founders" e.g. [[The Many]]:
		- *Natural features*
		- *Key landmarks*
		- *Ancient architecture*
		- *Compounds, structures, devices*
		- *Lairs and dungeons*
		- *Statues and shrines*
		- Anything "ancient" has "lore" around it that should be associated with [[The Many]]
		- No matter how small or big, there should be some mystique here
		- Connect mysteries of ancients structures with [[The Many]] at any given opportunity
- Monuments of [[The Many]] need to follow a strict guidelines for creation:
	- *Purpose* - each monument must have a reason for its existence, there are no vanity projects, since [[The Many]] were hunted and under time pressure
	- *Magic* - every monument is enchanted since [[The Many]] were master Mages
	- *Majesty* - every monument must have some element of grandeur and status, because [[The Many]] were architects
	- *Fortitude* - every monument must be over-designed to last for ages, because [[The Many]] were obsessed with legacy
	- *Secrecy* - every monument must have something hidden about it, using the Cipher Text somewhere in it, because [[The Many]] kept secrets close

**Introducing the [[Shard]]s**
- [[The Many]] created 8 powerful artifacts, one for each member
- When [[The Final Day of The Many]] passed, each was locked away behind some sort of puzzle for protection
- They are the final key to the monuments of [[The Many]]
- Anyone who possesses all 8 [[Shard]]s has the ability to control [[The Mist Codex]], the "computer" of [[The Many]]
