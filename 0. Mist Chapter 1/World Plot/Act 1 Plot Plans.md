**Who has done what**
- [[Fedorov's Legion]] approached [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] for an alliance
- They then brought in [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]]
- They crafted a plan:
	- They would levy the mighty Archmagi [[Silvan Gile]]'s powers (who is really [[Ignel Valis]] in disguise) to raise the aspect of [[The Stormlord]], dubbed [[Karak-Ulgurath]]
	- [[Silvan Gile]] requested more help, and sought out the knowledge of the Infernal, making a friendly agreement with [[Voramas]], Archdevil of [[The Umbral Cabal]]
	- [[Voramas]] joined in good standing because he recognized the might of the alliance forming and wishes to preserve [[The Umbral Cabal]], regardless of moral or side
	- They would use a Shrine, a [[Shrines of The Many]], to [[The Stormlord]] as a conduit for [[Karak-Ulgurath]]'s power
	- They would use [[Fedorov's Legion]] as a method of communication
	- [[Tennyson Heralds]] would act to rally the people of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] to his word, and eventually use his influence to rally the people to the new alliance's side 
	- This would be the founding of [[The Cutthroat Authority]]
- This would bring in [[The Aquan Nations]] because of [[Karak-Ulgurath]]
- In [[The Aquan Nations]], it was prophesized that every 500 years, an aspect of [[The Stormlord]] would rise to proclaim a new prophecy and future for all [[The Aquan Nations]] for the next 500 years
- This time, when raised, the prophecy (forced by [[Fedorov's Legion]]) was that [[The Aquan Nations]] would rise to conquer [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] as their own territory, flooding the lands and turning them into a marshland to live in. 
	- While [[The Aquan Nations]] see [[Karak-Ulgurath]]'s raising as a gesture of peace, [[Fedorov's Legion]] leadership has other motives
	- By raising the aspect themselves, [[Silvan Gile]], 
- [[The Aquan Nations]] now seek the conquest of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] and [[Gandoras City]] and [[Fedorov's Legion]] will offer support
- In return, [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and [[Silvan Gile]] request the might of [[The Aquan Nations]] to search for a lost artifact that they call a [[Shard]]
	- This is a [[Shard]] of [[The Many]]
	- There are two in [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
		- One in [[The First Compound]] bordering [[The Bay of Kelp]]
		- One in [[The Sunken Caverns]] where the Main Hold is and the lair of [[Karak-Ulgurath]]
- [[The Aquan Nations]] offer their elite casters to harbor prisoners of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] to both mine [[The Sunken Caverns]] for an artifact called a **[[Shard]]**, and research that [[Shard]] through a network of captured Librarians, [[Vivian Lovejoy]] included. 
	- This is why the miners from [[Saddle-Port]] and [[Vivian Lovejoy]] are imprisoned
	- The miners excavate the caved in ruins of underground complexes of [[The Many]]
	- The librarians are controlled as a think tank to research old texts research the monuments of [[The Many]]
	- The librarians also are forced to enchant for [[Fedorov's Legion]], used as grunt work for long, laborious, and draining enchantment rituals 
- This plan to attack [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] starts with raids for prisoners: Librarians and Miners. This is first
- Then after a while, intimidation raids will occur to scare people. There are bigger, bolder attacks on fishing fleets and whole towns. 
- Then they launch full scale destruction efforts, aiming to wipe out the Western most towns, further from [[Gandoras City]]
- This will force [[Gandoras City]] to enact its legions and spread them over [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] in a drawn out war effort.
- This is drawn out and long, in order to weaken the reserves of forces that [[Gandoras City]], [[The Seat of Stone]], and [[King Hyranthara]] have at their disposal. 
- In 9 months, far past the scope of [[Act 1 Plot Plans]], a full scale battle will rage with [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[Gandoras City]] leveraging powerful, ancient allies, to destroy, capture, and assert [[Garrick Blackthorn]] the new ruler of [[The Seat of Stone]] and [[Fedorov's Legion]] the keepers of [[The Chromatic Fangs]] and [[The Stormlocked Frontier]] as [[The Cutthroat Authority]], in joint leadership with [[The Black Guard]].

**Where will this act end**
- The party should aim to kill [[Karak-Ulgurath]], and weaken the forces of [[The Aquan Nations]]
- They will not confront either [[Tennyson Heralds]], [[Fedorov Barovick VII]], or [[Garrick Blackthorn]] yet. These are campaign-wide villains and end arcs for [[Deion Deus]]. 
- By killing [[Karak-Ulgurath]], the casters lose their potency and moral is lowered
- It will NOT stop an all out attack, but in the long term, it will make combating the war easier for [[Gandoras City]], and they will expend less troops, leaving more for the final attack on [[Gandoras City]] by the rest of the Antagonizing forces. 

**Stuff to Do**
- introduce more meaningful connections to [[The Umbral Cabal]] for [[Valyra Malzan]]
	- This means adding a series of known devils to [[The Umbral Cabal]]
	- Make sure to include relevance to [[Yugo Stolid]]
- Workout a connection from the devils of [[The Umbral Cabal]] to [[Fedorov's Legion]], [[The Iron-fist Marauders]], and [[The Followers of Alsolace]]
	- The Devils of [[The Umbral Cabal]] can be assisting them with recruitment
	- The Devils are associated with [[The Lord of the Hells]] as their deity
	- Maybe they know rituals to raise powerful forces of devils and the undead
	- Then we can tie this to [[Tennyson Heralds]] drawing his powers from [[The Lord of the Hells]]
- Begin to frame the big 3: [[Fedorov Barovick VII]], [[Tennyson Heralds]], and [[Garrick Blackthorn]] as the true masterminds and the real villains as the group kills [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and frees [[Vivian Lovejoy]]. 
	- [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] are henchmen of [[Garrick Blackthorn]]
	- [[The Followers of Alsolace]] are henchmen of [[Tennyson Heralds]]
	- [[Fedorov's Legion]] and eventually [[The Black Guard]] are henchmen to [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]
	- [[The Umbral Cabal]] are direct consultants to [[Fedorov Barovick VII]]
- Begin to introduce connections to [[The Chromatic Fangs]], and potential ancient things the Antagonists can leverage:
	- [[Scorvorria the Ember Greatwyrm]] as an ally to [[Garrick Blackthorn]]
	- An ancient magic staff to raise armies of the undead for [[Silvan Gile]]
- Begin to seed [[Tennyson Heralds]] as a dangerous character to be dealt with in [[Gandoras City]] and have this be his next position of power after [[Gullhook]]
