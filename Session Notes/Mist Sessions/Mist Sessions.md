> This file contains information amassed during the duration of the first mist campaign. Now, with that said, I only realized that it made total sense to use this file as a storage place for things I've learned during the campaign during the time period between session 8 and session 9. Thus this document isn't totally up to date just yet.

# 1. General Rules of Thumb:
> This section contains information I, Ethan, have learned *from my players* over the course of the campaign. It is indexed by the session during which I learned a lesson and the session during which I asked players for feedback

## FromÂ [Mist S7 07-07-24](app://obsidian.md/Mist%20S7%2007-07-24)
General session idea was a mass combat with prep. Lots of NPCs that were controlled.
- Need AOE to deal with massive groups of enemies
    - Not necessarily spells/abilities but things to interact with as well
- Bigger combats are better much later, but less so earlier because less resources
- Controlling NPCs much stronger feels terrible
    - Why are the player characters the adventurers if the NPCs are crazy stronger
    - Felt like Attack, that's it, Attack, that's it and repeat and repeat
- Combat idea from a Souls-like:
    - You have to kill an enemy before more of its kind comes
- The combat was good overall and the prep part was very good
    - The prep mattering was good
