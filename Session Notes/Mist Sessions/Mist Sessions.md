> This file contains information amassed during the duration of the first mist campaign. Now, with that said, I only realized that it made total sense to use this file as a storage place for things I've learned during the campaign during the time period between session 8 and session 9. Thus this document isn't totally up to date just yet.

# 1. General Rules of Thumb:
> This section contains information I, Ethan, have learned *from my players* over the course of the campaign. It is indexed by the session during which I learned a lesson and the session during which I asked players for feedback

## FromÂ [Mist S7 07-07-24](app://obsidian.md/Mist%20S7%2007-07-24)
General session idea was a mass combat with prep. Lots of NPCs that were controlled.
- Need AOE to deal with massive groups of enemies
    - Not necessarily spells/abilities but things to interact with as well
- Bigger combats are better much later, but less so earlier because less resources
- Controlling NPCs much stronger feels terrible
    - Why are the player characters the adventurers if the NPCs are crazy stronger
    - Felt like Attack, that's it, Attack, that's it and repeat and repeat
- Combat idea from a Souls-like:
    - You have to kill an enemy before more of its kind comes **bold**
- The combat was good overall and the prep part was very good *italics*
    - The prep mattering was good

**My takeaway:** Don't give players NPCs to play. Unless leading phalanxes of troops in open warfare, it feels terrible. Less but more powerful enemies > more weaker enemies because group lacks AoE for now. Really need to figure out interacting with stuff in combat; need more options to do for free. 
# 2. Character Stuff & Ideas
Any Idea that is checked off and ~~strike through~~ has been implemented already. This is just to track ideas to add:

- [ ] Hunter's guild in [[Gullhook]] ties to [[The Green Order]] in [[The Twilight Woods]]
- [ ] Chugga's bar tournament w/ [[Ball Knockers]]
- [ ] Work on Livy from [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] & tie to [[The Forest Freaks]]
- [ ] [[Puck]] takes [[Deion Deus]]'s Hands with super poison dagger
	- [ ] [[Puck]] seduced by [[Garrick Blackthorn]], [[Deion Deus]] framed in [[Puck]]'s mind as a weakling and a coward for not killing those kids
	- [ ] [[Puck]] stands over [[Deion Deus]]: "I could finish you, but I won't. Then it's not on my shoulders that I killed ya, you're just weak. Just like Garrick told me."
	- [ ] [[Puck]] lures [[Deion Deus]] to back room being friendly, then does this. Chop of hand with [[Deion Deus]]'s own hand-axe.
- [ ] Super long way off but have affair between [[Livy Revals]] and [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] be a weapon for stripping [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] of his right to rule [[Fedorov's Legion]]. Add something to [[Fedorov's Legion]] to make their affair and their child from it a method to invalidate his rule. 
	- [ ] flesh out rules for this
	- [ ] flesh out child that they had
- [ ] Start seeding ideas for a war on [[The South-East Coast]] between [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[The Blue Coat Brigade]]
- [ ] Get a new sheet of NPC names and RACEs table for quick reference
- [ ] Integrate quests in mission doc more neatly and divide by region in Gullhook. 
- [ ] Figure out moonrat's enemy for mission in Chugga's. 
- [ ] Draw map of [[Gullhook]] and [[The High Forests]] 
- [ ] Update and re-format player data sheets for [[Wake]] [[Deion Deus]] [[Slug Stoll]] and [[Kelswin Lovejoy]]
