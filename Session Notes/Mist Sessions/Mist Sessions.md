> This file contains information amassed during the duration of the first mist campaign. Now, with that said, I only realized that it made total sense to use this file as a storage place for things I've learned during the campaign during the time period between session 8 and session 9. Thus this document isn't totally up to date just yet.

# 1. General Rules of Thumb
> [!NOTE] Preface
> This section contains data that I have gathered from my players after sessions, regarding change, improvements, and edits they wish to be implemented in the campaign. However, trust and improvement are a two way street and I hope that after each section, I can add somethings that I would love to see from the players as well. I usually don't have much but in general, if after hearing their feedback I have a note, I will jot it down and bring it up the next session. 

## FromÂ [Mist S7 07-07-24](app://obsidian.md/Mist%20S7%2007-07-24)
General session idea was a mass combat with prep. Lots of NPCs that were controlled.
- Need AOE to deal with massive groups of enemies
    - Not necessarily spells/abilities but things to interact with as well
- Bigger combats are better much later, but less so earlier because less resources
- Controlling NPCs much stronger feels terrible
    - Why are the player characters the adventurers if the NPCs are crazy stronger
    - Felt like Attack, that's it, Attack, that's it and repeat and repeat
- Combat idea from a Souls-like:
    - You have to kill an enemy before more of its kind comes **bold**
- The combat was good overall and the prep part was very good *italics*
    - The prep mattering was good

**My takeaway:** Don't give players NPCs to play. Unless leading phalanxes of troops in open warfare, it feels terrible. A player character, run by the DM, that exceeds the power of the group diminishes their enjoyment from being powerful themselves. *Make a weak DMPC* that is there for flavor and don't use them as an excuse to RP with yourself. *Use them to play off player characters to lead them into roleplay* to make them look good. As for combat, less but more powerful enemies is superior to more weaker enemies because group lacks AoE for now. Really need to figure out interacting with stuff in combat; need more options to do for free. 
## From [[Mist S10 07-27-2024]]
Roleplay is good:
- just enjoying the idea that you can talk to people
- different persons
Learning small funny things is appealing
From JP:
- create situations that characters can clearly work through using only an ability that a specific character has 
- steal something, option to use ability outside of combat
From Sean:
- one thing
- try for options to be able to stick together to do a side quests
They all want dungeons haha

**My Takeaway:** The group wants to play as a group, not as individuals doing their own missions. They came here to play together so *don't incentivize splitting up on missions* unless it is really plot-relevant like a dungeon or to chase someone. Incentivize working together on side quests and tasks by giving the party hook that appeal to multiple character at once: magic, religion, lore, secrets, strength, fighting all in one. The idea should be to include an element of the hook that is keyed towards each player. This ties in well with the second point of *giving players cool ways to use abilities outside of combat.* My games are only about 30% to 40% combat, so that is a majority of the time not spent fighting, Make sure there are opportunities outside of pure combat to actively use a players abilities. 
# 2. Character/Mission/Item Ideas
Any Idea that is checked off and ~~strike through~~ has been implemented already. This is just to track ideas to add:

- [ ] Hunter's guild in [[Gullhook]] ties to [[The Green Order]] in [[The Twilight Woods]]
- [ ] Flesh out quest to clear the salvage yard in [[Gullhook]]
- [x] Chugga's bar tournament w/ [[Ball Knockers]] **Run Already, [[Gullhook]]**
- [ ] Work on Livy from [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] & tie to [[The Forest Freaks]]
- [ ] [[Puck]] takes [[Deion Deus]]'s Hands with super poison dagger
	- [ ] [[Puck]] seduced by [[Garrick Blackthorn]], [[Deion Deus]] framed in [[Puck]]'s mind as a weakling and a coward for not killing those kids
	- [ ] [[Puck]] stands over [[Deion Deus]]: "I could finish you, but I won't. Then it's not on my shoulders that I killed ya, you're just weak. Just like Garrick told me."
	- [ ] [[Puck]] lures [[Deion Deus]] to back room being friendly, then does this. Chop of hand with [[Deion Deus]]'s own hand-axe.
- [ ] Super long way off but have affair between [[Livy Revals]] and [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] be a weapon for stripping [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] of his right to rule [[Fedorov's Legion]]. Add something to [[Fedorov's Legion]] to make their affair and their child from it a method to invalidate his rule. 
	- [ ] flesh out rules for this
	- [ ] flesh out child that they had
- [ ] Start seeding ideas for a war on [[The South-East Coast]] between [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[The Blue Coat Brigade]]
- [ ] Get a new sheet of NPC names and races table for quick reference
- [ ] Integrate quests in mission doc more neatly and divide by region in Gullhook. 
- [ ] Figure out moonrat's enemy for mission in Chugga's. 
- [x] Draw map of [[Gullhook]], **Finished Drawing, paper note**
- [ ] Draw map of the [[The High Forests]] 
- [ ] Update and re-format player data sheets for [[Wake]] [[Deion Deus]] [[Slug Stoll]] and [[Kelswin Lovejoy]]
- [ ] I referenced the author to a book on smithing in [[Gullhook]] named McAllister. Place him in Briar's Forge. Have him have clues about the vanishings and ideas about the forest and weapons. 
- [ ] Enemy who they fight, the enemy runs or the party runs, and then they fight again later e.g. a recurring enemy that they know about. 
- [ ] Build an order known as the "Exultant"
- [ ] Add surfing mini quest idea
# 3. Item Ideas
- [ ] glass blade, increased crit chance and damage but on a 5 or lower on a d20, after an attack, the blade shatters in a 10 ft radius, dex save dc 15 versus 3d8 damage
- [ ] Item called "Scream Blade" that does less damage, but doubles the save required to hold concentration on a spell and deals more damage to spell casters. 
- [ ] Prep tattoos for offering at Ink 
# 3. Fight Ideas
- [ ] Enemy that is anchored to an object through magical means. They get dragged towards the object if not within a certain radius. 
- [ ] Some lair effect that causes chains to drag a player within melee range of a powerful enemy. It is blocked if you can keep something within line of sight of you and the creature to stop the chain dragging you. 
- [ ] Try making a creature that is based on the old UA class of Mystic
