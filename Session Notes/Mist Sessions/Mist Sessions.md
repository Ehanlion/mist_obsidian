> This file contains information amassed during the duration of the first mist campaign. Now, with that said, I only realized that it made total sense to use this file as a storage place for things I've learned during the campaign during the time period between session 8 and session 9. Thus this document isn't totally up to date just yet.

# 1. General Rules of Thumb
> [!NOTE] Preface
> This section contains data that I have gathered from my players after sessions, regarding change, improvements, and edits they wish to be implemented in the campaign. However, trust and improvement are a two way street and I hope that after each section, I can add somethings that I would love to see from the players as well. I usually don't have much but in general, if after hearing their feedback I have a note, I will jot it down and bring it up the next session. 
## FromÂ [Mist S7 07-07-24](app://obsidian.md/Mist%20S7%2007-07-24)
General session idea was a mass combat with prep. Lots of NPCs that were controlled.
- Need AOE to deal with massive groups of enemies
    - Not necessarily spells/abilities but things to interact with as well
- Bigger combats are better much later, but less so earlier because less resources
- Controlling NPCs much stronger feels terrible
    - Why are the player characters the adventurers if the NPCs are crazy stronger
    - Felt like Attack, that's it, Attack, that's it and repeat and repeat
- Combat idea from a Souls-like:
    - You have to kill an enemy before more of its kind comes **bold**
- The combat was good overall and the prep part was very good *italics*
    - The prep mattering was good

**My takeaway:** Don't give players NPCs to play. Unless leading phalanxes of troops in open warfare, it feels terrible. A player character, run by the DM, that exceeds the power of the group diminishes their enjoyment from being powerful themselves. *Make a weak DMPC* that is there for flavor and don't use them as an excuse to RP with yourself. *Use them to play off player characters to lead them into roleplay* to make them look good. As for combat, less but more powerful enemies is superior to more weaker enemies because group lacks AoE for now. Really need to figure out interacting with stuff in combat; need more options to do for free. 
## From [[Mist S10 7-27-2024]]
Roleplay is good:
- just enjoying the idea that you can talk to people
- different persons
Learning small funny things is appealing
From JP:
- create situations that characters can clearly work through using only an ability that a specific character has 
- steal something, option to use ability outside of combat
From Sean:
- one thing
- try for options to be able to stick together to do a side quests
They all want dungeons haha

**My Takeaway:** The group wants to play as a group, not as individuals doing their own missions. They came here to play together so *don't incentivize splitting up on missions* unless it is really plot-relevant like a dungeon or to chase someone. Incentivize working together on side quests and tasks by giving the party hook that appeal to multiple character at once: magic, religion, lore, secrets, strength, fighting all in one. The idea should be to include an element of the hook that is keyed towards each player. This ties in well with the second point of *giving players cool ways to use abilities outside of combat.* My games are only about 30% to 40% combat, so that is a majority of the time not spent fighting, Make sure there are opportunities outside of pure combat to actively use a players abilities. 
## From Chris on 8/7/2024 - DM to DM Chat
What is Chris's methodology:
- their campaign is all in the same place
- Don't worry about small in between lists, instead make "hit lists" of things you want to do within the city by the end of session and then include them based on how the session is going.
- Sometimes, if something doesn't feel right to put in, then push back that idea and hold it for a next session.
	- prep a combat and go to safe spot? push it back
	- prep an NPC and they don't talk to any? push it back
	- prep a location and group avoids? push it back

Asking Chris about clues:
- know from Alice that the pale woman = matron of ravens, patron of death and fate
- gray woman linked to knowledge
- green woman linked to wild mother
- spider queen is linked to something else 
- they know 5 regions:

How to get clues the best way:
- cool to learn as a reward for doing other stuff
- explore and talk to the right people is good
- people need to have specialties and get rewarded with clues 
- Cool to have things hidden behind literal barriers linked to each player's strength 

Chris preps areas and people in those areas and then ad libs outside of that 

Price magic items in a way where items that are going to be very appealing to the commonfolk are in high demand, and  thus are high cost whereas a powerful but unusual item wouldn't be super pricey 
# 2. Character/Mission Ideas
Any Idea that is checked off and ~~strike through~~ has been implemented already. This is just to track ideas to add:

- [ ] Hunter's guild in [[Gullhook]] ties to [[The Green Order]] in [[The Twilight Woods]]
- [ ] Flesh out quest to clear the salvage yard in [[Gullhook]]
- [x] Chugga's bar tournament w/ [[Ball Knockers]] **Run Already**
- [ ] Work on Livy from [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] & tie to [[The Forest Freaks]]
	- [ ] Make Livy a Hag and add a Haven Coven and a windmill as a joke alluding to Curse of Strahd. The windmill is for LOLs but the Hags are legit.  
- [x] [[Puck]] takes [[Deion Deus]]'s Hands with super poison dagger **Run Already**
	- [x] [[Puck]] seduced by [[Garrick Blackthorn]], [[Deion Deus]] framed in [[Puck]]'s mind as a weakling and a coward for not killing those kids, 
	- [x] [[Puck]] stands over [[Deion Deus]]: "I could finish you, but I won't. Then it's not on my shoulders that I killed ya, you're just weak. Just like Garrick told me." 
	- [x] [[Puck]] lures [[Deion Deus]] to back room being friendly, then does this. Chop of hand with [[Deion Deus]]'s own hand-axe. 
- [ ] Super long way off but have affair between [[Livy Revals]] and [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] be a weapon for stripping [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] of his right to rule [[Fedorov's Legion]]. Add something to [[Fedorov's Legion]] to make their affair and their child from it a method to invalidate his rule. 
	- [ ] flesh out rules for this
	- [ ] flesh out child that they had
- [ ] Start seeding ideas for a war on [[The South-East Coast]] between [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[The Blue Coat Brigade]]
- [ ] Get a new sheet of NPC names and races table for quick reference
- [ ] Integrate quests in mission doc more neatly and divide by region in Gullhook. 
- [x] Figure out moonrat's enemy for mission in Chugga's.  **Ran Tavern, was fun**
- [x] Draw map of [[Gullhook]], **Finished Drawing, paper note**
- [ ] Draw map of the [[The High Forests]] 
- [ ] Update and re-format player data sheets for [[Wake Tiraus]] [[Deion Deus]] [[Slug Stoll]] and [[Kelswin Lovejoy]]
- [x] I referenced the author to a book on smithing in [[Gullhook]] named McAllister. Place him in Briar's Forge. Have him have clues about the vanishings and ideas about the forest and weapons.  **Ran for Slug Already**
- [ ] Build an order known as the "Exultant"
	- [ ] Use this as the order to J's second character for [[Gandoras City]] and the order of clerical workers who follow [[The Everlight]]
- [ ] Add surfing mini quest idea
- [ ] Work on [[Vivian Lovejoy]]'s journal that [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] found and is reading.
- [ ] A cave of ice with frozen bodies in the walls, frozen in combat poses. an ancient white dragon prowls the cave and hunts. It protects a secret entrance to something important. 
- [x] Implement 6-level exhaustion system with 2x EL penalty to d20 rolls and 5x EL penalty in feet to movement. Exhaustion after being downed in combat and coming back. Applies to initiative but not death saves.  **Added prototype**
	- [ ] Maybe add an adrenaline system onto this 
- [x] flesh out inspiration system to give inspiration more. give for never going down in combat, landing a lot of crits, doing 3/4 a monsters hp solo or something, exceptional social interaction, solving a riddle, finding a clue, etc...  **Added prototype**
- [x] When meeting [[Karak-Ulgurath]], they hear a layered voice of [[Ignel Valis]] (as Silvan Gile) speaking through it saying, bow to my old pet underlings or something.  **Added to note.**
- [x] Write document for highlighting factions and groups in [[Hope Town]] and the pirate legions like [[Fedorov's Legion]], [[The Dead-Tide Reapers]], and [[The Blue Coat Brigade]].  **Written and shared with Wake Already**
	- [x] Write a GM copy as well with more info
- [ ] Add funeral even in [[Gullhook]] honoring [[Dmitri Mironov]] after being killed. Called an honored friend of [[Tennyson Heralds]]. Second poster talking about [[Alsolace]] needing gold strength to fight [[Erstorndin]] who's agent was a wraith of the night ([[Wake Tiraus]])
- [x] Talk with Ashley and create Character sheet for character
	- [x] Race, class, ability score rolls, roll hit points
	- [x] Find a good magic item and give some gold to start with
- [ ] Figure out what to put in [[Valyra Malzan]]'s Infernal puzzle box
- [x] Work on ways to get into green order via either Being a Druid/Ranger, born into order, or if underage offered asylum and then kicked out of the order later if they don't embrace their principles.  **Added to note on the Order**
- [ ] Add a puzzle that is just a standard Caesar's cipher and the shift amount is uncovered somewhere within the room. Maybe the number can be found by examining paintings of spells, and each painting corresponds to a different spell of a different element. Looking closer, GM describes the spell and players have to figure which spell it is. Then to find the clue its like FIRE + FIRE - ICE + AIR - EARTH and that corresponds to the levels of the spell being combined. 
- [ ] Add an element of [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] that is a ticking clock. In some amount of time it will shut off, [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]] will dissipate and Mist will reunite with the world outside. [[The Divine Barrier]] will fall. however, it will expose the island to [[The Scintillating Order]] who are told by [[The Many]] to seek the destruction of Mist. It can only be repowered with all of the [[Shards]] reassembled and reunited. People like [[Silvan Gile]] work to get some [[Shards]] for their own devices and seek to use them for greedy purposes in their own rituals to prevent this occurrence. 
- [ ] Incredibly hard puzzle room with requirement for magic, contained in an orb that players can be pulled into it
- [ ] Add someone for [[Wake Tiraus]] that is apart of [[Fedorov's Legion]] that enters into combat to try and kill [[Wake Tiraus]] for killing [[Dmitri Mironov]] and [[Igor Larionov]]. They must allude to the notion that they have spies inside [[The Blue Coat Brigade]] and know [[Wake Tiraus]]'s true name! 
	- [ ] Even add an element of using dominate monster or something to control a party member and RP it as this member of [[Fedorov's Legion]]'s thanking them for their spying and insider information. Prolly target [[Deion Deus]] because [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[The Iron-fist Marauders]] get along well.
# 3. Item/Ability Ideas
- [ ] glass blade, increased crit chance and damage but on a 5 or lower on a d20, after an attack, the blade shatters in a 10 ft radius, dex save dc 15 versus 3d8 damage
- [ ] Item called "Scream Blade" that does less damage, but doubles the save required to hold concentration on a spell and deals more damage to spell casters. 
- [x] Prep tattoos for offering at Ink  **Kelswin acquired tattoo**

# 3. Fight Ideas
- [ ] Enemy that is anchored to an object through magical means. They get dragged towards the object if not within a certain radius. 
- [ ] Some lair effect that causes chains to drag a player within melee range of a powerful enemy. It is blocked if you can keep something within line of sight of you and the creature to stop the chain dragging you. 
- [ ] Try making a creature that is based on the old UA class of Mystic
- [ ] Dragon who's breath attack curses magic items (wisdom save for magic item) and causes chaos
- [ ] Enemy that copies the next attack that it gets hit by and empowers it. Call it a mimic or something. 
- [ ] Enemy that hunts using purely scent and hearing without vision, describe as blind and kind of spazzy and jerky with movement. Hook horror kind of things
- [ ] Enemy who they fight, the enemy runs or the party runs, and then they fight again later e.g. a recurring enemy that they know about. 
- [ ] Not really a fight, but an important figure whom they are searching for in a complex. They find their study room. The party enters. On the desk is the note yet to be sealed, still open to read. Write the note on paper for the players. "Dear X and X, This is so and so. Don't be alarmed. I know the group is coming to search this complex. We have nothing to worry about. One of our own is still undercover within the Ranks, all as we planned. See you soon. from - so and so. "
- [ ] Enemy that cannot be killed but is slow and constantly hunts the group. Need way to make sure they right it, recognize it is super deadly and that they have to run from it. 
# 4. Folder Maintenance 
- [ ] Organize all folders better? Figure out way to do this please god
- [ ] Come up with new name for island, use the note as a general index for the island. 
- [ ] re-build each region note as an index, as if it were the start of the chapter
- [ ] LONG TERM - assimilate methods from this link [reddit mega post on obsidian for D&D](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/v9uorp/obsidianmd_the_perfect_free_campaign_manager/)
