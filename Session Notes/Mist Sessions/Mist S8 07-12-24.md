Campaign: [[Mist Sessions]]
Predecessor: [[Mist S7 07-07-24]]
# Notes reference
This file did not reference a prep notes document. I kind of free-balled it but also expected the players to roleplay with themselves to fill the session out.
# Session Notes
> This session was intended to be an RP heavy session, focusing on players reacting to the damages from the prior session.
# Session Starts:
- The group does a recap all together because I ask them to
- They start overlooking the cliffs at Saddle-port after the fight with the Sahuaguin raiders
- The group oversaw burial rites for those lost in battle:
	- Bon, Frelbeth, and Havram the timber workers
	- Vance the iron worker
	- Betty the bull
	- And those that are lost but not dead: Ryo, Elyon, Alysse the miners and Vivian Lovejoy 
- The tombs stand stoic overlooking the distant sea, atop the great white cliffs
- Wake rolls a Nat 20 performance check to play a respectful tune for those that fell during the fight
	- This inspires some of the aspiring townsfolk to join in and compliment Wake
	- By word of mouth, it would be fun to pass on by word of mouth that Wake is a muse for respectful, mourning tunes
# Comfort and a plan forwards:
- Deion takes the role of the comforter
- Deion tries his best to talk to Kelswin
- Kelswin seems resolute and bitter; distant and cold
	- I think Chris is doing an excellent job roleplaying Kelswin as helpless and lost after Vivian was taken from saddle port
	- It is my read that Sean is playing Deion to see a shard of himself within Kelswin
- Deion says out loud that he thinks the miners + Vivian are in one of the sea caves
- Deion considers how the village can be reborn and rebuilt
	- Religion is relevant
	- Gods matter to the people
- Deion talks to Jordan about the sea cave and who would come
	- Jordan thinks Menard might come, but he doesn't
	- Burton would not come, he is too depressed from losing Betty
- Kelswin finds multiple things in wreckage of library
	- cloak from mother
	- 3 pearls in cloak
	- shreds of burned map of coast

Deion is awarded, by me, the boon of the townsfolk because he demonstrated a unique ability to interact with, rally, and motivate the downtrodden townsfolk after the battle of saddle port.
# A devilish conversation 
- Deion has made a deal with Yugo
	- Refresher:
	- Yugo guaranteed that all the party would live through the saddle port fight
	- Deion promised that, when the time comes, he would do Yugo a favor upon Yugo's express request, without possibility of refusal. 
- Deion now talks to Yugo again about things
	- Yugo mentions a shop called "The Other Way" run by Arnov Vasilov
		- I could make Arnov a friend of Yugo and an escapee of the south east coast and the hope town pirate factions  
	- Yugo gives Deion an enchanted compass
	- It leads to somewhere within the deep woods to the place where Yugo will go 
		- This place will be a magical tavern filled with runaway devils, demons, and such
		- It will be located deep within the Deep woods
# To ask the gods for help:
- Deion and Kelswin make their way to a small knoll outside of town where there are shrines to gods:
	- Kelswin leaves coins for the Changebringer
	- Deion talks to a women, the wife of one of the timber workers, who says there are some young woods worker apprentices in the town
# Wake practices with a blade:
- After coming to life after the saddle port fight, wake created a wave cutter blade, reminiscent of the blades the Sahuaguin wave masters use
- Menard is interested in the blade
- They spar, Menard uses his Great axe and Wake uses their wave cutter blade
	- Wake demonstrates that finesse and dex are just as lethal as pure strength
- Menard is inspired to stay in Saddle port and perfect making the wave cutter blade
# The Wood Worker Revolution:
- Okay this was goofy
- the group looks for wood workers to help rebuild the village
- they find 3 11-12 year old kids who were apprenticing for a couple months
- Kelswin finds books on intro wood craft
- the kids are instructed to lead the fishermen in learning wood skills
- After time this is what will happen:
	- The child that was put in charge is called "The king of wood"
		- Brant is the lead child
		- Lewis and Bow are lieutenant children
	- the children will teach the fishermen bad wood crafting
	- the fishermen, who have no boats, only want to build boats
	- the fishermen build really terrible boats 
	- Menard arms them with bad wave cutter blades
	- bad pirates are now created
# Kelswin and the mind rock
- Kelswin wants to inspect the gem Deion found
	- This is the mind rock controlling one of the crabs
- Kelswin uses detect magic
	- Mind rock shows up as necromancy
	- cloak shows up as abjuration and stuff, its magic and elemental and stuff
	- idk my schools of magic to be honest
- Mind rock touches Kelswin for identify
	- Kelswin fails charisma save against it
	- Kelswin sees visions of Karak Ulgurath commanding him to move against his friends
- Deion, Kelswin, Wake fight
- Wake eventually removes the stone with a DC20 strength check
- Once the stone is ripped off, Kelswin makes con save, DC20 versus 8d8 necrotic damage
	- on a fail, 8d8 necrotic damage + con score reduced by 1d8 until cured
	- the wound is hard to close
- Kelswin learns that the rock is called a mind rock
- Kelswin sees visions of Karak ulgurath 
- Kelswin now has:
	- 3 wild magic pearls (roll 2x on sorcerer wild magic table)
	- Cloak of energy absorption 
# Craft and leave
- Deion tries to create a set of crab armor from the carcass of the crab
- Settles for a shield
	- New type of shield:
		- Spiny crab shield, reaction shield bash, 5ft range, 1d6 piercing damage
		- Heavy crab shield, -10 speed, resistance to bludgeoning and slashing damage
	- New type of armor:
		- Spiny crab armor, 
		- Heavy crab armor,
- The group sets off to leave to smears burrow
- it is a 2 day journey through the thunderstorm
- things they saw along the way:
	- Wake and Deion see a kraken battling 2 boats, one boat sinks
	- Kelswin sees a giant fist sweeping through the shrouds
		- This is a frost bound warden, its form ripples through the mist
- The group eventually makes it to smears-burrow 
- However we had THIS first:
	- Wake talks about being from the fey
		- This was NOT cleared with me -> no planar connection apart from water plane
		- Wake says they have memory of Fey ???????
		- Sure this works, but like by pure luck and no other reason
	- Kelswin wonders where he is actually from?
	- He is a Satyr, thus is Fey, but no memory of Fey? So where does he come from?
		- Answer is Deep Woods (sorta fey-ish there)
- The big thing about planes is that there is no known connection to planes and no ability to open any portals
- Eventually, the group roleplays and ends up in smears burrow 
# Ending the session in Smears-burrow
- The group gets in
- Kelswin talks to Satyr in Tavern about where they are from
- Satyr's name is Bellatrix, she is from the Deep Woods
- Kelswin confused
- They talk to elders in village for help: Freya, Buster Croaks, and Simon
- Freya says road between Gullhook and Anchor point is patrolled by Bandits
	- The bandits base out of the high forests that surround the echoing grotto 
- They offer the group a 'boat' since they did help out Smears-burrow
- The boat is a really really really terrible raft but the group accept
- they set sail towards the thunderstorm on the horizon, e.g. south (back towards saddle port ish)
- The raft is called "The Seaworthy"
