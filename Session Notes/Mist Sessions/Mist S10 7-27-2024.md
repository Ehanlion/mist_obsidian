Campaign: [[Mist Sessions]]
Prior Session: [[Mist S10 7-27-2024]]
# Session Start
- The group begins the day in a small cave just north of saddle port, with the intent of sailing back south to saddle port before heading up north to smears burrow and then gull hook
- discussion about riddle occurs, but group is *very* split on meaning and understanding
	- **I need to lead them better and give more concrete information and references**
- group debates exploring the cave that they missed in the last session and choose to sail back up to the cave before sailing back down south towards saddle port
- weather has died down from a raging thunderstorm to a heavy drizzle with lightning flashes further inland
- As they are sailing they see:
	- A dark blue vessel sailing far out in the sea from where the seaworthy is sailing
	- it is going much faster, about 5x the speed
	- They see a black flag flying from a mast and glittering weapons decorating the decks
	- Group wonders if it is His Majesty's ship (they realize it is not, the ship was bright crimson red and gold)
	- they see the ship has a sharp, cutting prow 
- The group enters the cave and finds an octopus with a barnacle stuck to it
	- Wake enters water attempting friendly contact, and succeeds with a high Animal Handling roll
	- Kelswin and Wake sing in harmony and get the barnacle to fall off however, it was harder because only 2 helped. 
		- **If 4 sing a minor chord together then the barnacle auto-breaks**
## Keeping Vivian Alive
The group starts to roll d20s
	- *they are to see if Vivian is alive*
	- I am ruling that if they roll a natural 1, roll a d8
		- 1 lose sight, 2 lose hearing, 3 lose left arm, 4 lost right arm, 5 lose left leg, 6 lose right leg, 7 lost nothing, 8 outright die.
		- If they rolled a 7, they are fine however
		- If they roll anything else, on the next natural 1 Vivian dies
		- stick to these, don't BS them because it adds REAL drama to how quickly they figure out the riddle
	- Keep ruling d20s at the end of each in game day

I accidentally added *a lot* of tridents with Reggie Brown's initials which is fine, the group was just getting hooked on the idea that there being so many tridents was an indicator of something more and not just me being slow-thinking on the fly haha. 

# Back to Saddle-port
- As they are sailing back south from the cave towards saddle port, Deion looks into the shrouds of mist and sees an arm of a warden swishing through the shrouds
- They get back to saddle port
- They have to get up the cliff
- no one manning the crane to list ships up on the edge of the cliff 
- Wake decides to climb using a vortex warp from Kelswin, piton skills, and makes their way to the top
- Burton is very drunk and very sad, nearly hurts them operating crane and sort of forgets how to wrangle the oxen to spin the turn styles
- Deion, as they are being winched up, notices that the seas are very empty and that there are no ships here
- Slug tries to read a book about dagger making and it opens to a page saying"
	- Mastering the Basics of Dagger Making, Everything that YOU need to know
	- Written by Smithy McAllister
- Kelswin reads Vivian's journal and spell book that he got
	- the section says in short that Vivian was doing research for the Green Order and that, about 20-25 years ago she stopped and had a library built in saddle port where she would move to
## The Boats are Being Made:
- Brant, the small child who was put in charge, is leading the way
- He is VERY power hungry and the fishermen and him have been working without reading the book on woods crafting further
- Grant maybe can read book? Possibly can only read the images and work off that but it is ambiguous. 
- Grant is called "commander" by the group
- They are making a boat, but they have not figured out how to do curves so it is made 100% out of straight edges and 90 degree bends
- This is a hilarious moment for the group just seeing the boat, and I the GM am pretty proud of that
## Heading Out?
- Group weighs more money verus learning about the clues
- group decides to head to altars outside of the town to try and co reference the altars versus the clues, but they don't learn anything here
- The group, unable to reach their raft, travels on cart-back with two drawn draft horses, towards Gull hook
- Deion talks in depth about his home and past
	- how he grew up in the mountains
	- how it was harsh and cold and cruel
	- how he ran and made his way to the city of Gandoras to start a new life
	- how he had a friend, Puck, who he was always close to and had to leave
- The arrive in saddle port during afternoon  and are greeted by guards
	- they kill a horse for having a sneaky barnacle on it 
	- the group tries to stop it but too slow, they instead share the idea that harmonious noise can break them with the guards
- Remember, the group has a shipment that they need to get to the guild hall.
- They walk into the town and are in awe by the color and diversity
- Lots of damage, looks like there was a raid. Plenty of giant crab shells littering the outskirts of the town, now with honorary memorials in front, tombstones, and flowers planted and growing
# Welcome to Gull-hook
- They immediately meat a shift half elf that introduces self as Glorval, saying he is a frequent of Chugga's rowdy bar and is a beast at Ball Knockers, a variant of Pool the GM created. 
- Referenced to dock yard guild hall to deliver their shipment
- Makes their way to this part of town
- The guild hall is massive, circular building alight with activity and bustling with pirates, sailors, deckhands, commerce workers, trade masters, guild masters, the hunting party, and colorful characters looking for work
- The meet with a trades master to deliver shipment, it is accepted and registers, and then the group is referred to a commerce master, named Glee they later find out (who is also a chiller and love to play Ball knockers at Chugga's), who helps sort out their payment
## Talking to the Hunt Masters
- **Okay I need to update and fix the hunt masters after this session lmfao**
- The group looks for hunts, missions to search the dangerous high woods for lost persons in light of the recent raids
	- Their missions are like this:
		- kill quests for monsters in the forest
		- Requests for specific, rare creature parts from forest
		- search and find missions to retrieve lost persons in light of recent raid
		- explorations missions to find:
			- the revitalizing spring
			- The wishing pong
			- other odd locations hidden in forest
			- lost shrines to the mother father prime/betrayer gods of the forest 
- I framed the high forest as very dangerous
	- In actuality it isn't insane, just parts of it like the Charmed Royalties and the Widow Maker's Stands
	- Those parts that are dangerous are killer though
