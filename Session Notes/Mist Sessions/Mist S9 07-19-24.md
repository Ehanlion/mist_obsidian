Campaign: [[Mist Sessions]]
Prior: [[Mist S8 07-12-24]]
# The Idea I outlined at like 1:30 am or something:
- Party starts on a raft and is looking to search the sea caves between saddle port and smears burrow
- Each sea cave contains part of a clue to lead the group to a secret Sahuaguin staging area
# The Clues I made:
The clues are a series of vague descriptions about places within the High Forest. There are 4 locations and 5 statues of gods, these are those locations/gods:
1. The Distant Overlook
2. The Revitalizing Spring 
3. The Wishing Pond
4. The Bay of Kelp
5. [[The Wildmother]]
6. [[The Whispered One]]
7. [[The Matron of Ravens]]
8. [[The Spider Queen]]
9. [[The Knowing Mentor]]

**The opening blurb to the riddle is as follows:**
Travel the hidden journey, 
prayers to lost divinities,
of hidden sigil and rights or wrongs,
keyed entry of two is found. 

| Deity/Location              | Clue                            | Alignment |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| [[The Distant Overlook]]    | The point of whale spotting     | Good      |
| [[The Wildmother]]          | The green woman                 | Neutral   |
| [[The Wishing Pond]]        | The wishing pond                | Neutral   |
| [[The Whispered One]]       | The father of death             | Evil      |
| [[The Knowing Mentor]]      | The gray-robed woman            | Neutral   |
| [[The Matron of Ravens]]    | The pale woman                  | Neutral   |
| [[The Revitalizing Spring]] | The revitalizing spring         | Good      |
| [[The Spider Queen]]        | The opulent, alluring woman     | Evil      |
| [[The Bay of Kelp]]         | The churning, green ocean waves | Neutral   |
- At each location lies a rune of the ancient language of the many
- The players must find this rune at each of the sites
- Furthermore, the players must decide the alignment, good evil or neutral, or each entry on the list.
- At the entrances to the compound, there are passkey inputs, since it was a site of the many
	- One passkey it the runes, placed in order in which the sites are listed on the riddle
	- The second is inputting the alignments, with good at the bottom near a good aligned dragon and the evil at the top near an evil aligned dragon
##### Splitting the Riddle
I split the riddle into 3 pages, with one, 4th page, as a full master copy. The three pages each contained part of the riddle and when held up to the light, revealed the true riddle. They figured this out in like 3 second cause I was excited but still super cool to see them excited and holding the riddle up to the light. 
# Onto the Actual Session Notes
There were 5 caves:
- Lover's cave
- Underwater cave
- High tide cave
- Low Tide cave
- The cave with a rock pillar that I didn't describe to the players well, whoopsie GM moment

- The group starts on The Seaworthy sailing down the coast towards Lover's cave, the thunderstorm looming in the distance 
- The group sails to lovers cave and reaches it
- They enter the cave
- They notice stagnant bloods spots on the floor (from Slug in the past) and a bloated Sahuaguin corpse lying face up in the water in the cave
- Wake is only one that can read Aquan so they can read the note that is left
	- Note talks about acquisition orders for member of towns on the coast

| Name   | Captured? | Dead? | Location  |
| ------ | --------- | ----- | --------- |
| Ryo    | Yes       | No    | Compound  |
| Elyon  | Yes       | Yes   | Compound  |
| Alysse | Yes       | No    | Compound  |
| Vivian | Yes       | No    | Main Hold |
- The compound is an ancient underground hang out of the many, located under the high forest with access from the bay of kelp and the high forest
- The Main hold is in the sunken caverns and is close to where Karak Ulgurath dwells
	- High important prisoners are taken their for their minds to be enslaved and used by Karak Ulgurath 
# To Push on or shrimp out
- Deion is REALLY adamant that they turn around
- Kelswin and Wake want to push on towards the storm
- Deion begrudgingly agrees 
	- Great roleplay by Sean here, super cool to sea Deion's fears realized this well
- Wake references "a friend of ashen skin in the Deep woods" referring to their Alt character Erisen (spell check please ???) that they know in the forests.
- The next cave they reach is the underwater cave
	- This cave is sick, guarded by friendly jellyfish, a tight tunnel network, and a super dense kelp forest to navigate, all while holding their breath.
- They swim inwards, Kelswin uses light cantrip to light up Deion's head
- Deion takes the lead but is scared of swimming, lot of hesitating which costs them valuable time
- They get to the kelp forest, requires strength to push through
- Deion takes lead, forcing kelp out of the way while Wake and Kelswin swim in the pocket that moving the kelp creates
- 30 seconds of air left for Wake right as they are about to get to top
- Last surge by Deion pushes kelp aside and they reach surface
- Jordan drowns, is stabilized by Kelswin and needs 1 hour to rest. 
- They find an alchemists abode, riddled with tomes about creating alchemic brews
	- Recipes for paralysis potions: Mindflayer stinkhorn and Moonstalker 
	- and for water breathing potions: water elemental droplet and Gillyweed 
- They also find a page of clues, 1/3 of the riddle above
- When they get back to the raft, Deion says how much he hates water
- Deion tries to use trident of manual returning to spear a jellyfish
	- Funny miscommunication on my part. Mostly the players, I definitely described the jellyfish as being 15 feet long and huge
- He spears a jellyfish, it begins to tug him back into the water. Jordan and him try to pull it back and barely succeed.
- Jellyfish all become angry and glow, Deion pulls the trident back, the raft shoots off into the ocean and the jellyfish fade back into the cave
# Into the Storm
- They begin to sail into the storm more
- Deion and Jordan become exhausted from the storm
- Wake sees a kraken lurking off in the distance and a blue dragon, shrouded in the storm, races past overhead
	- Wake does not mention this as to not scare Deion
- They make it to the high tide cave and sail right in
- This cave clearly has a torture room setup
- There is a water tank with barnacles inside that are still alive
- The group learns from a book about them that loud sounds can destroy them
	- I meant for this to be a cool lead in to a bard honor class or something
	- They instead create a massive gold gong and smash it repeatedly 
- The book on the growths is written by S. Gile
	- Remember Ignel Valise and S. Gile? Yeah, that's this. Boom lets go
	- Barnacles susceptible to very very loud noises, especially resonance and overlapping frequencies
	- The barnacles are parasitic
- They find clue number 2/3
# Okay the Storm gets REALLY rough here
- The storm picks up drastically
- The raft is REALLY getting tossed around
- The waves begin to push them towards the cliffs, 300 feet to go
- Deion and Jordan begin to haul on the oars
- Wake realizes steering wont help
- Mast snaps into piece, Kelswin reaction grabs part of it with mage hand
- Will take 20 minutes to repair, they don't have that amount of time
- Kelswin and Slug begin to repair the mast as fast as they can
- Jordan snaps an oar, Deion is failing, they are pushed to within 150 feet of the cliff in just 30 seconds
- Wake realizes they can use a wind gust spell to blast air into the stricken sail to gust them away
- Deion and Jordan drop the oars
	- Yes, this means they lose the oars and are down to just one remaining
- Deion and Jordan grab the sail and hold it in their hands
- Wake casts the spell, massive blowing gust of air coalesces and rips through the raft
- Strength checks all around to not get throw off
	- Everyone somehow succeeds this
	- Really figured someone was going to go into the sea = death
- They accelerate rapidly, cresting wave after wave, just barely climbing over the crests before the water crashes down into the ocean
- Kelswin and Slug finish repairing the mast and they remount the sail
- They sail like this while the wind carries them
- Now they are lost, amidst a raging thunderstorm at sea, with no sense of direction
- Kelswin summons a compass and realizes that they have been blown far north and need to sail south
# The final leg of the journey
- They opt to sail south, back into the thunderstorm and away from the safer waters to the north. 
- Exhaustion sets into the group. Kelswin fails and is exhausted
- They sail for hours upon hours
- A glister storm, described to them as a blowing cloud of rainbow, shimmer particles, gusts over them. Charisma saves for everyone, only Deion fails.
	- The storm invokes Deion with unrelenting bouts of strong emotion and conjures memories of his times back in the iron first marauders 
	- He sees puck, the blood stone pass
	- He sits on the boat but feels ice on his face and sees himself sitting on the bloodstone pass
	- Present and past are mixed in with each other
	- Wake tries to calm him, telling him to , in his vision, to close his eyes over and over.
	- Deion sees himself leaving the pass, venturing towards Gandoras city, getting a job, making his way around the highlands, and finally entering the tavern to meet Kelswin for the first time
- They reach the final cave after surviving the storm
- Inside they find the final pieces of the riddle, 3/3. They put it together
- They also get fragments of the map of the highlands so their group map is more complete
- The riddle is very confusing which is good
	- their first ideas were that all 9 items are local gods to towns up north?
		- honestly pretty close
	- My adjustment is going to be to make sure the gods are referred to in a similar way to the riddle in the towns and then make sure townsfolk play up the mystery of the woods, the lost statues of divinities, and the strange points of interest that they have tales about
