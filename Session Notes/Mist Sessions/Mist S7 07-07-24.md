These enemies were used:
- Sahuaguin
- Sahuaguin High Priestess
- Sahuaguin Baron
- Sahuaguin Blade master
- Reference Ghosts of Saltmarsh for HP and BM. 

Custom created siege crab from hill giant stat block with re-flavor 
## Starting Combat:
- Players controlled NPCs directly after their turn
- Split up NPCs evenly-ish between players
- Enemies focused *not on players but on getting Vivian Lovejoy and the Miners.*
- Big Moments:
	- Siege crabs are heard, only by Kelswin, and arrive from the cliff
	- Mass reinforcements arrive 
	- I did NOT use the barnacle growths during combat and should have
	- Tavern is attacked and partially demolished by Crab in order to abduct miners
	- Crab knocks out and captures Vivian
	- Party is on deaths door

##### A Devilish Deal:
- Deion accepts mid combat deal with Yugo Stolid, who is a devil
	- Yugo is a Devil but seemingly could NOT attack enemies - only buff allies
- The contract states the following:
	- Yugo will guarantee the party lives, it will cost him greatly. 
	- Yugo will use diamonds (he obtained at great cost) and revivify the party
	- Deion agrees that, when the time comes for Yugo to ask a favor, Deion delivers at any cost, no refusal possible
	- *Deion does not fully read contract in heat of battle*
##### Death to Everyone:
- The enemies escape:
	- They captured Vivian and fed her some draught or potion
	- They captured the dead miners and used cursed magic to bring them back to life
- Kelswin downed
- Then Slug
- Then Wake
- Then Deion
- Death saves begin for group
- *Really bad rolls, everyone in party dies*
- Revivify give *the option to the soul to come back*
- This is what happens to each player:
	- Deion:
		- Sees Puck, his childhood friend
		- Meets him on the eternal battle field believed in by the Iron Fist Marauders
		- Puck offers him his hand and a way back to life
		- Deion takes it
	- Kelswin:
		- Shrouded by cooling mist and shimmering water
		- Hears his mother calling to him
		- Spectral form of mother talks to Kelswin
		- Sweet embrace, she tells him not to worry, that she is proud
		- She tells Kelswin he is destined for great things and offers him her hand back to life
		- Kelswin takes it
	- Slug:
		- Is surrounded by heat and hot desert sand blowing
			- Jackson has a sick one liner of "oh this must be Hell and we all laugh"
		- Hears two peoples voices calling to him
		- They are his lost parents
		- His dad is a renowned Dagger Merchant on the south east coast
		- They tell him they can't wait to see him again
		- They both grab his hand and offer him a way back to life
		- Slug takes it
		- Slug wakes with a beautiful dagger on his belt, it will lead him to them
	- Wake:
		- Preface: I thought Wake would stay dead and J would get a new character
		- Immersed in the fathomless depths of the ocean, surrounded by currents and water
		- Below Wake opens a vast maw, the Storm Lord
		- His voice resonates with the water loudly
		- It is good to see Wake again, surprised to see them so soon 
		- Storm lord always favored Wake
		- Wake sees visage of themselves
		- They call themselves the King of the Beach, it is what Wake could become
		- They offer their hand to Wake as a way back, Wake denies it
		- Correct choice, was a test, the visage laughs as Wake is offered a way back to life
		- Wake takes it

## Combat is Over, time for the Damage:
- This section of town is ruined
- Library in a churning inferno
- Kelswin is dismayed
- Kelswin dashes in to **grab mother's spell book** amidst the inferno
- Slug watched Deion and Kelswin stand, shrouded by the rains embrace, as the churning flames of the library rage in the background, consuming books of old and Kelswin's home. 
- NPCs are mostly dead:
	- Herbert and Alice Shaw make it (cooks)
	- Jordan makes it 
	- Burton makes it (betty dead though)
	- Menard makes it (iron worker)
	- Vivian is captured but known to be alive
- Families come out from hiding and cry
- Deion organizes the families and fishermen to help put fires out
- Burial rites by the sea cliffs fulfilled, tombs not marked with image to mark to day
	- The group sees this combat as a day that should not be marked 

This session ends, the group is overlooking the storm raging upon the Distant Sea. The tombstones sit perched atop the cliff, the town out to pay respects with flittering torches raised in hand. The group stands together against the storm, oncoming. 
# Important Takeaways:
- Sometimes, enemies goal in combat **is not to kill players,** but rather to get something else; in this case, the Sahuaguin group wanted to abduct Vivian and Miners and happened to run into a fight. 
- It feels terrible, as a player, to control an NPC **that is higher CR/power-level than you.** Controlling them is fine, but **players need to be the powerful ones.**
- Don't tell the party if NPCs live or die based on death saves. Making death saves is great, but keep tension high by not telling the players until they go check the NPC.
