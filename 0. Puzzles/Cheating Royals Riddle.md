This is a good riddle from Ted Talks: [Cheating Royals Riddle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk9c7sJ08Bg)

Might need to make easier though, group is NOT good at math

This could be fun though, they choose a royal like in the puzzle, but then if they chose the wrong one, the next rooms are like that person is "governing" e.g. they feel like they are being cheated or maybe it just makes things harder for them all
