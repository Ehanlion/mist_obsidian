## Match the Mirror
**Match the Mirror:**Â The reflection shown in the mirror in this room isn't right. There's an extra object, or an object missing (or even an extra person!). The players need to find the missing object, and place it in the right spot in the mirror to pass.
## Treasure Horde Trick
**Treasure Trick**: A chest in the room is empty. There is a mirror on the wall, that shows everything to be normal, except that the chest contains treasures and magic items. As the party watches in the mirror, and old man comes and removes an item from the mirror-chest and leaves again. He does this repeatedly until the chest is empty, at which time he points at the party and laughs hysterically. If the mirror is tilted on its side, the remaining treasure will spill out of the chest upon the floor, both in the mirror and in reality. If the old man is present when this happens, he will also fall down and appear in the room, where he will answer one question truthfully (with a cryptic riddle of course)before cackling and disappearing in a puff of smoke.

**Easy to Read List:**
## Tesseract Mirror
**Tesseract Mirror**: There is a mirror on the wall. It can be removed from the wall, but is just a bit too large to remove from the room without breaking it. The mirror appears to show a reflection of the room (complete with reflected characters), but if it is moved, it will be seen to be a magic portal into another room. It can be placed on all four walls, as well as the ceiling and floor, and on each wall it opens into a different chamber. The mirror is the only way to reach these chambers. A character can step through the mirror, like quicksilver, but will find that the party's "evil twins" are in the room in the mirror. -- And his "evil twin" exits just as he was entering. The evil twins will attack the party instantly, but any attacks on a twin also affect the real character, and vice versa. If one dies, the other dies. (How to deal with this, I have no idea!) Each of the six rooms has a piece of a key, and when all six parts are assembled, it leads somewhere else. If the mirror is broken, the rooms become inaccessible, but the evil twins will continue to stalk the party through mirrors and reflections.
## The Infinite Staircase
**The Infinite Staircase**: A staircase spirals upward endlessly, but no matter how far the adventurers climb, they return to the same landing. The solution lies in stepping backward onto the stairs while holding a mirror, "reflecting" themselves into a new level of reality.
