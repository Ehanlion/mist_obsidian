[Link to cool Magic Staffs etc.](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/magic-items/rods-staves-wands/) This can add a lot of cool magical staffs for the party to get or learn about. 

[5esrd Master Magic Items List](https://www.5esrd.com/database/magicitem/) This is a full list of every possible magic item that the players could use. It is both RAW and add-on rules sets, as well as some home-brew (I think).

#### Non-Standard Items:

**Master Mind Rock and Mind Rock:**
Powerful rocks that allow the owner of the Master rock to enslave a creature attacked to the normal mind rock. The Master mind rock carries out anything done by the normal rock. If a creature is mind-slaved to the creature with the normal rock and that creature is killed, the creature is now mind-slaved to the master rock.

# Where the Keys are?
The keys are powerful artifacts and their locations are detailed within the document for [[The Many]].
