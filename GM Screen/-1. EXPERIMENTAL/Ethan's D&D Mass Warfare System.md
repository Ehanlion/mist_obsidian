# System Idea
- Mass warfare system to allow conducting of large-scale wars and combats. Focused on breaking D&D to allow for troop movements, attacks, unit to unit combat, while still supporting players and their actions
- Driven to balance an incentive/cost structure for players weighing the risks of being a commander.

## 1. Unit Basics 
### What are Units?
A combat *unit* is a cohesive group of troops. These can be martial fighters, supporting clerics, blasting casters, ranged archers, or highly mobile cavalry. Regardless of types, a *unit* work together, must muster on its own, must remain in good spirts in combat to avoid fleeing, and fights alongside other units in mass-combat. A unit attacks as one group. A unit may attack *another unit* or a unit may choose to *attack a creature*. These cases are dealt with in later sections. Furthermore, units can take damage from *other units* or the unit can suffer at the hands of an *attack from a larger,  significant creature.* 
### Important Stat Block Components
A units is characterized by the following, key, fields:
1. **Unit Armor Class (AC)**: A unit has a given armor class, used for both unit-unit and creature-unit attacks
2. **Unit Speed**: A unit has a given speed that it can move in a turn.
3. **Unit Stats**: Units have all the same stats as creatures, listed only as modifiers as the raw scores do not matter.
4. **Unit Saves**: Units do not have proficiency in saving throws. Only when led by a commander can they gain this extra bonus.
5. **Unit Attacks**: Units do not have proficiency in attacks. Only when led by a commander can they gain this extra bonus. 
6. **Core Unit Hitpoints**: Units have a set number of core unit hitpoints. These are scalar and depend on units types: Heavy, martial, scout, ranged, caster.
7. **Impact Hitpoints**: Units have a second type of hitpoints to manage creature to unit attacks. This number is usually much larger than the core unit hitpoints. 
### Mechanics of a Unit
In combat, *units* function very similarly to normal creatures with some exceptions. Units roll their *own initiative*, or if they are under the *influence of a commander*, they take their turn immediately after the commander's initiative turn. A unit *uses their action and moves*, and if they have one, *they will use a bonus action*. 
#### Core Unit Hitpoints
#### Impact Hitpoints
#### Attacking and Attack Types
#### Other Combat Actions
A combat unit has three distinct other types of actions as listed below:
1. **Reactions**: A unit inherits normal types of reactions like opportunity attacks. 
2. **Bonus Actions**: A unit may have bonus actions or they may not, in which case this is skipped. 
3. **Free Actions**: A unit can choose to, for free, make a check or shelter in place. 
#### Defense, AC, and Saves
## 2. Commanders
### What is a Commander?
In combat, *Units* act independently under what is known as *general command.* In this state they follow similar units, react to general orders from generals and shot-callers, and preserve themselves. They gain no special bonuses outside of their base stat blocks. However, in special cases, *Units* can be augmented if *they are led by a commander.* A player character may take up the role of being a commander, given they have a good reason to. As detailed later, a commander has *base minimum requirements* that must be met in order to lead. However, the forces that a commander instructs must also *respect their commander*. This is not an explicitly defined rule; a commander cannot lead well a group that directly hates them. If troops are willing to follow a commander, then they can gain special augmentations from their the commander. These include bonuses to speed, hit points, health, damage, and most importantly, morale and muster saves. Thus commanders can make *units* much more powerful. 

Be warned though, a commander links themselves with a *unit*. They *must* remain with their unit in order to give it their command boost. Later, it will be described how an exemplary commander can instruct multiple units. While this is true, a commander must remain with a *core unit* that they choose to be a part of in order to do this. If the commander leaves this unit, *all units they are commanding* are released from their command and act as independent units *under general command.* The tradeoff to these bonuses is that a commander *takes all damage that their unit does.* A commander makes their own saves and is treated as having their own AC. In the case where an attack beats both a *unit's* and the *commander's* AC, it deals damage to both. If an effect requires a saving throw, the unit and commander make it, but the effect damages both. This is the cost of being a leader. 
### What Makes a Good Commander?
A commander is defined by their natural leadership, steeled nerves, and unwavering confidence in the face of adversity. As a result a good commander is both charismatic and deeply proficient in the type of combat their units specialize in. A mage should not lead a group of tribal warriors in the same way that a barbarian is not the best commander for a strike force of casters.
### The Commander's Influence
A commander can span their influence across many combat *Units*, given they are able to. A commander is best defined by *their Charisma.* A commander may influence a number of individual *Units,* *equal to their Charisma Modifier.* Each *Unit* acts independently but under the lead of one commander. The commander that guides multiple units *links themselves to only one*. The commander does not take damage alongside every unit, just the one they act with. A commander may influence their units and grant them the advantage of a commander, even from a distance. However, these units must remain in the commander's region of influence.  A commander's *region of influence* is a factor of proficiency and charisma; a commander's units may act under the commanders influence if they remain within a range of *the commanders proficiency bonus times their charisma bonus time 20*. A creature with a proficiency of +3, and a charisma bonus of +5, influences their units to a maximum range of 160 feet. If these units leave exceed this range, they act *like independent units in general command,* and whilst this happens, *they try to fulfill their last order and preserve themselves.*
### Commanders and the GM's Influence
In combat you have two forces competing to control the *units*. Players, acting as commanders, will want to directly control their units and the GM will want to preserve a level of realism and not have this happen. My solution is a happy medium of these. Players that are acting as *commanders for units* can directly specify actions. This includes *attacks, reactions, and bonus actions*. A player always rolls attack rolls, damage dice, saving throws, and checks for a unit. A player can also instruct a unit on *how* they should move but they cannot directly move the unit. Think of it as a command: "Move that way," "charge that other unit," "shelter from oncoming arrow barrage," and so on. Remember, it is *the GM* who gets the final control in directly moving units on the battle map. Commanders may give *instructions*, but the GM *realizes those instructions*. If you give a bad command as a commander, well then prepare for your unit to misbehave. It is on you, the commander, to give good commands. 
### Mechanics of a Commander Unit
The following are statistics that are improved with the oversight and leadership of a commander:
1. **Attacks**: A commander adds their proficiency bonus to their unit's attacks.
2. **Saves**: A unit gains the saving throw proficiencies of their commander. If a commander has a saving throw proficiency, the unit gets to add their commander's proficiency bonus to their saves.
3. **Movement**: A unit gains any bonuses to movement that a commander has. This bonus must be either from a feat, or a class; race bonuses do not help nor hinder a commanded unit's movement.
4. **Class Abilities**:  The unit benefits from a commander's class abilities. 

It is worth noting that these definitions are a little bit vague. Simply put, it is hard to determine if a given class ability should be extended to a unit. *Race abilities do not extend to a commanded unit*. In addition, a unit doesn't gain spell casting, or augmentations to their castable spells (if the unit is a caster-type) from the commander's spell list. 
#### Example of a Commanded Unit
When you command a unit, it becomes and improved unit and gains simple bonuses to some of its fields. Some bonuses are variable. For instance, *a unit's movement* may improve if the *commander gets a bonus to their movement.* Race abilities cannot augment a unit, only class abilities can (this includes feats).

## 3. Unit Combat
## 4. Types of Units
### Generic Overview of Unit Classes
Unit classes are divided into 4 main types: *Martial, scout, mounted, and caster.* Martial units excel at hand to hand combat in the thick of a fight. A scout unit excels at poking from a distance, skirting the edges of battle, and rapid movement. Mounted units dominate flanks of a battle with their maneuverability and strike-and-disappear capabilities. Finally, caster types can divide into supports or blasters, both being highly vulnerable but extremely powerful; they are able to shape a battle if managed properly and left to their devices.
