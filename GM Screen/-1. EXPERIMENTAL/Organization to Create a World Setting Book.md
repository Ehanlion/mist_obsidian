# Preface

> [!Note] JTE: Understanding the Problem
> A lot of what I created for Mist is currently excellent. But right now, I feel like I have a lot of content and not much direction. To create a world, I feel like I have to have so many arms or trains of thought, when realistically, I should only have one at a time. Good planning would make this easy, but it's not always trivial to add new ideas to a tracker. Most of my good ideas are had at my desk at work, while driving my car, or while not sitting exactly in the right spot to jot them down. As such, I see fit to re-attempt my approach at structuring this campaign setting into something better: *building a whole campaign setting, in the context of a book.*
> 
> 	Goal: Create a stand-alone campaign setting, in the context of D&D 5e and D&D 2024
> 	Method: Restructure the current campaign setting by pruning the unnecessary, then re-focus on a more structured approach to development 

**Okay Ethan ...** that seems kind of ambiguous right? Where exactly should we go with this?

Okay easy, but how? *What do I need to do first?* 
- Start by sifting through all that good stuff you have already created, trimming out unneeded branches and then migrating what is good into a new obsidian vault
- Then once the files have been migrated and the working area is cleaned, write a doctrine.
- This doctrine should contain a short, simple, easy to adhere to list of yes-do and no-do items that I need to focus on in future development.
- This list needs to be like gospel and law, don't **ever** stray from it, because it lays out the guidelines for not getting distracted. 
- These should be general laws though, because I need to have just enough wiggle room under them to create and not enough wiggle room to confuse myself of the process
# Chapters
1. **Breaking Down the Existing:** Focus on merging the old with a new vault, what to look for, how to prune, guidelines for doing this process
2. **Creating a Better Structure:** What are some ideas that I have to create a more rigid but flexible structure for this project?
3. **The Doctrine of Structure:** A written set of law-like rules never to be strayed from during creative development.
