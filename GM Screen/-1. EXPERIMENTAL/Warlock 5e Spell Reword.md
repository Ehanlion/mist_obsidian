Rules Set: [[D&D Optional Mechanics]]
# Why a Rework
A warlock gets only 2 spell slots all the way up to level 11. That is brutal, when you look at a wizard who gets 17 by that same level. While the argument could be made that warlock has access to eldritch blast and the invocations that go with it, I think the Warlock should at least have access to some more spell slots to allow for more diversity.

## Additional Spells
The warlock class now gains additional spells slots, based on the spell slot progression table from the [Ranger Class](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/ranger). Now, at a given level, the Warlock class gains not only their Warlock-slots, but now they gain additional slots called *Eldritch Slots.* 
## Limitations
The gained spell slots are limited to *a maximum of 2 per spell slot level.* This means that at 5th level, even though a *ranger* would have 4 first level spell slots, the Warlock would only be able to gain 2 first level spell slots and thus would have *2 first level Eldritch Slots*. Additionally, the Warlock gains *Eldritch Slots* at a rate of 1 fewer per level compared to a Ranger. That means that, while a Ranger at level 2 would have 2 first level spell slots, the Warlock gains one less than this at this level, so the Warlock would only have *1 first level Eldritch slot.* 

**Let's Summarize:**

| **Level** | **Ranger Slots**              | **1st** | **2nd** | **Warlock Slots**             | **1st** | **2nd** |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1         | 0 slots                       | 0       | 0       | 0 slots                       | 0       | 0       |
| 2         | 2, 1st level slots            | 2       | 0       | 1 1st level Eldritch Slot     | 1       | 0       |
| 3         | 3, 1st level slots            | 3       | 0       | 2, 1st level Eldritch Slots   | 2       | 0       |
| 4         | 3, 1st level slots            | 3       | 0       | 2, 1st level Eldritch Slots   | 2       | 0       |
| 5         | 4, 1st level and 2, 2nd level | 4       | 2       | 2, 1st level and 1, 2nd level | 2       | 1       |
## Recharging Slots
The Warlock Class normally recharges their spells slots on *a short rest.* This is still the case! However, now that they have the additional Eldritch Slots (From the Ranger Class), those *do not recharge on a short rest.* They instead recharge, as a Ranger does, on a long rest only! This keeps it a little bit more balanced. 
## Notes on Balancing
Since, at the time of writing this, I have a Wizard and Sorcerer in my party, I am taking extra care to make sure this system *does not* put a Warlock anywhere close to these other classes in terms of raw spell slots at their disposal. It is in the nature of the Wizard, and also sort of the Sorcerer, to be able to have lots of slots. My aim with this rework is to simple expand the Warlocks casting power to allow for more creative uses of spells while not challenging the outright casting power of a Wizard or Sorcerer.
