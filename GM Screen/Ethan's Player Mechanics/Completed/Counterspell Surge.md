# Description:
In places of extreme magic sometimes the redaction of a spell with a counterspell results in a surge of magic. If the GM decides that an area is one of outstanding magical influence, then it is appropriate to involve counterspell surges with casting in the area.
# Mechanics:
**Basic Mechanics:**
If a spell is successfully counterspelled, it causes a wild magic surge centered on both the caster and the counterspeller (so two surges). Both creatures rolls on the sorcerer wild magic table and the effects instantly occur. 

**Extreme Mechanics:** 
In the extreme variant of the rule, the basic mechanics persist but then on top of that, whenever a spell of third level or higher is cast, it also causes a wild magic surge centered on the caster.
