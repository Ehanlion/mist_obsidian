# Ability Description
You enter a defensive stance, using your prowess with powerful melee attacks to defend against attacks. You stand your ground behind shield and sword to use your agility and strength to push back against powerful attacks. 

	Transfer martial attacks to defense. If you have attacks that you can make, you can instead use them in defense whilst in this stance. Note that you can only use unused attacks that can be made as part of your attack action for this ability.

	If an attack is made against you, ranged or martial, you can use your weapon to attack. Roll your attack damage. Reduce the incoming damage by the amount you rolled. If the damage you rolled with your weapon exceeds the damage that would've been dealt to you, you take no damage and instead, deal the remaing damage to the attacker. You can only deal damage if the attack was within your attack range. 

	You also gain advantage against effects that would displace you while this ability is active. 

## Learning the abilities:
If you learn this stance, you cannot easily use it. It takes battle and combat as well as training to truly hone your ability. You start as a novice with this stance, and can progress to learned, and finally to master.

As a novice, the damage you roll against oncoming attacks is halved (as if the attacker was resistant). As a learned, the damage rolled is not modifier. As a master, you add your character level to the damage rolled, increasing your effectiveness. 
## Ability Usages:
You can use this stance as a bonus action, a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.
