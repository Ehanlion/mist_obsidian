Rules Index: [[D&D Optional Mechanics]]
# Mechanic
Exhaustion works on a *six point scale*, just as in [[exhaustion (depreciated)]]. However it now just means that you incur a penalty on D20 Checks, excluding *deaths saves* and including *initiative rolls*, and a penalty to movement. 

The penalty to D20 check is **2x the level of exhaustion.**
The penalty to movement is **5x the level of exhaustion.**

You die *after* you incur another level of exhaustion once you are at your sixth level of exhaustion. 
# Getting Exhaustion levels
- Forced march, past 8 hours, roll a Con save DC 15 for every 2 hours past
