Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
# Description:
The new system of exhaustion introduced by ONEDND is ruled as follows. I think it is both harsher and more forgiving than the original exhaustion system.
# Mechanics:
For every level of exhaustion a player has, they gain a minus 1 modifier to all d20 rolls. This applies to attacks, saves, checks, basically anything that requires a d20 roll applies this modifier. You can gain up to 10 levels of exhaustion. If at any point you exceed 10 levels of exhaustion (with 10 levels being the maximum) your character instantly and fully dies. 

**Removing Exhaustion:**
A player can remove one level of exhaustion per long rest that they take. 10 levels of exhaustion means you need 10 long rests to fully remove it.

**Forcing Exhaustion:**
Exhaustion should always be saved for and not just given. Increasing the DC for the exhaustion is a much better way to preserve player initiative rather than just forcing a level on a player as a punishment. 
# Incurring Exhaustion:
Many factors can contribute to a player gaining a level of exhaustion. The following is a list of some of the things that can, however it is important to think that anything overly strenuous or overly exerting will cause a save for exhaustion. 
1. **Long Travel:** Pushing beyond 8 hours of travel causes levels of exhaustion. Role one save versus each 1 hours (rounding up) that were travelled for. Saves for long travel occur before a rest taken after the travel since each save occurs after the additional hour travelled. 
2. **Going Unconscious:** If a player falls [[unconscious]], they gain a level of exhaustion. This is the only time where exhaustion without a save is a reasonable choice. 
3. **Prolonged Alertness:** If a player doesn't get a long rest in a 24 hour period, make a DC 10 Constitution save verus a level of exhaustion. For every additional period the DC increased by 5, resetting after taking a long rest.
