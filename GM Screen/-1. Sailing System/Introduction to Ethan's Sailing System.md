Rules Index: [[D&D Optional Mechanics]]
*This is an optional system created by Ethan Owen, in which travel, sustain, and combat upon the high seas is detailed to great extent.*
# Intro Message
Hello! My name is Ethan Owen and this is my system for **Sailing the High Seas.** This system is designed to allow for full-scale naval exploration, adventure, and combat. I will discuss the mechanics of boats, hiring and keeping crews, optional affixes for boats, deep sea creature encounters, weather systems, and most importantly, ship to ship combat. This system is designed to be presented to players with basic explanations of the rules and, weirdly, it is **designed to feel overwhelming to play at first.** My reasoning is that players likely do not have prior experience of captaining a ship and, like an in-game player character would experience for the first time when taking on this task, the player should feel confused. I want there to be a steep learning curve, I want there to be a sense of panic at not knowing things perfectly, and I want all of this to simulate **not being informed enough to make 100% perfect decisions while sailing your ship.** Feeling flustered and cornered in real life while using the rules will translate perfectly to chaos and mistakes in game that will have, as I intend, very real consequences.

# The Structure of a Ship
## Key Terms
**Hull Health**: A ship has a certain amount of health. When that health reaches 0, the ship begins the process of singing.
**Damage Threshold**: A ship only takes hull damage when a certain threshold is reached in one single attack. Once it does, this damage translates to hull damage.
**Cargo Capacity**: A ship can carry a certain amount of cargo. It is dependent on both weight and cargo capacity in terms of storage space. 
**Movement Speed**: A ship can move a certain amount of squares in one turn. These are divided into, idle, luffing, full chap, and over speed. It must obey max turning angles. 
**Max Turn Angle**: A ship must turn gradually and not instantly. A ship can only move at a certain maximum diagonal when moving. This angle becomes slimmer at higher speeds.
**Reactions to Wind**: A ship can either slow, accelerate, or take damage, given the direction of winds that blows. Winds are ever-changing and captains must be vigilant. 
**Max Speed**: A ship has a maximum speed threshold. When it is exceeded, the ship must make saves against taking damage from over speeding.
**Over Speeding**: Over speeding is a ship condition where the ship exceeds its max speed. Once this happens the ship begins to break apart. It can be sustained, but at a high level of risk
**Sinking**: Once a ship's health is reduced below 0, it sinks. A ship sinks in a given number of rounds. This can be slowed or accelerated by external factors, but it always has a baseline.
**Control Methods**: A ship must be controlled by a captain who issues ordered to his lesser. Those lesser execute the order, but the captain must steer or delegate his helmsman to 
# Crewing a Ship
## Key Terms
**Captain**: Leader of the ship. Companies directly appoint captains while pirates democratically elect theirs. Crew relies on captain for all final orders. Captains orchestrates combat directives. 
**Helmsmen**: *Optional*. Steers the ship and mans the helm. Captains consults navigator and gives turn order or directly gives turn order in heat of combat. *If not taken, assumed by captain.*
**Navigator**: *Optional*. Consults star charts, navigation tools, and magic to guide a ship on its passage. Advises captain on course headings. *If not take, assumed by captain.*
**First Mate**: Carries our orders on the captains behalf. Second in command. An order given by a first mate is to be taken as an order from the captain unless the captains overrides with their own order. 
**Cook**: Responsible for preparing the food for the ship. Communes with quarter-master to use ships chest to buy food and stock the pantries.
**Quarter-Master**: Oversees cargo transactions, shipping manifests, and trade orders. Third in command. Manages crew's pay and loot distributions. Oversees the hold and keeps the hold clear of vermin. 
**Sail-Tenders**: *Optional*. If a ship has sails, it needs Sail-tenders. Responsible for manning the sails. Must raise/lower/change sails when given orders by the captain.
**Gunner**: *Optional*. If a ship has large weapons, it needs gunners. Gunners operate cannons, trebuchets, crossbows, or other mounted weapons. 
**Lookout**: Generally a creature with high perception, this position mans the crow's nest on the ship. Responsible to relaying sightings to captain/first mate/navigator for action. 
**Oarsmen**: *Optional*. If a ship has oars, it needs oarsmen. Oarsmen row the ship when it's not under sail power, namely in ports and rivers. 
**Engineer**: *Optional*. An engineer is optional, but recommended. The engineer repairs the ship on journeys and in ports, they oversee large-scale repairs done to ship.
**Grunt**: Generic crewmates of a ship. If a role is not assigned, by default a crew member is a grunt.
