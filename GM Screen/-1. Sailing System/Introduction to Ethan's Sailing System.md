Rules Index: [[D&D Optional Mechanics]]
*This is an optional system created by Ethan Owen, in which travel, sustain, and combat upon the high seas is detailed to great extent.*
# Intro Message
Hello! My name is Ethan Owen and this is my system for **Sailing the High Seas.** This system is designed to allow for full-scale naval exploration, adventure, and combat. I will discuss the mechanics of boats, hiring and keeping crews, optional affixes for boats, deep sea creature encounters, weather systems, and most importantly, ship to ship combat. This system is designed to be presented to players with basic explanations of the rules and, weirdly, it is **designed to feel overwhelming to play at first.** My reasoning is that players likely do not have prior experience of captaining a ship and, like an in-game player character would experience for the first time when taking on this task, the player should feel confused. I want there to be a steep learning curve, I want there to be a sense of panic at not knowing things perfectly, and I want all of this to simulate **not being informed enough to make 100% perfect decisions while sailing your ship.** Feeling flustered and cornered in real life while using the rules will translate perfectly to chaos and mistakes in game that will have, as I intend, very real consequences.
