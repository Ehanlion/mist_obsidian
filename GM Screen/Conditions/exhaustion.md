 **Exhaustion**
 -  There are 6 levels of exhaustion. 
	 -  Level 1: [[disadvantage]] on ability checks.
	 -  Level 2: speed halved.
	 -  Level 3: [[disadvantage]] on attack rolls and saving throws.
	 -  Level 4: hit point maximum halved.
	 -  Level 5: speed becomes zero.
	 -  Level 6: death.
 -   In general, exhaustion requires a success on a constitution saving throw versus a DC set by the GM appropriate for the situation. I like DC's 10, 13, 15, 17, 20. For the range of difficult to extremely strenuous conditions. 

**Exhaustion with travel**:
-  Waking up after over-exerting yourself the prior day for travel will incur exhaustion. 
	-  For every hour over 8 hours travelled, add +1 to the DC.
	-  For very hot weather, add +3 to the DC.
	-  For very rainy or cold weather, add +3 to the DC.
