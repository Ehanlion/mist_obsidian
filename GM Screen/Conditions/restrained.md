 **Restrained**
 -  A restrained creature's speed becomes zero, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
 -  Attack rolls against the creature have [[advantage]] and the restrained creature's attack are made with [[disadvantage]]. 
 -  The creature has [[disadvantage]] on dexterity saving throws. 
 -  General rule of thumb: It usually costs an action to break free from the restrained condition, however, there is nothing in the condition that mentions being unable to attack, speak, or anything to that end.
