# Description:
 - A petrified creature is transformed, along with any *non-magical* items that it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone, good for flavor to be dependent on the cause of the condition). 
 -  The petrified creature, after turning to an inanimate substance, 10x in weight and ceases to age. 
 -  Attack rolls made against the creature have [[advantage]]. 
 -  The petrified creature automatically fails all strength and dexterity saving throws.
 -  The creature has [[resistance]] to all damage types.
 -  The creature is immune to poison and disease, however a poison already in the creatures system is suspended and neutralized.
 -  Good house-rule is that a creature can be returned from the petrified condition so long as vital component of its form are still intact. e.g. a creature missing an arm can return, but will be missing an arm once returned.
