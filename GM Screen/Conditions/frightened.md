 **Frightened**
 -  A frightened creature has [[disadvantage]] on any ability check or attack roll while the source of its fear is within line of sight. 
 -  The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear (this means it can move away from the source or radially around the source).
 -  Good house-rule would be to allow creatures to save against frightened condition if they break line of sight with the source (simply closing your eyes to induce the [[blinded]] condition does not satisfy this requirement).
