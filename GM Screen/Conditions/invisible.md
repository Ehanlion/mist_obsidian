# Description:
 -  An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense.
 -  In terms of hiding while invisible, the creature is considered [[heavily obscured]]. The creature can only be detected by any noise or tracks that it leaves.
 -  Attack rolls against the creature (even if you succeed on a perception check while searching for the invisible creature), are always made at [[disadvantage]] and the invisible creature makes attack rolls against targets that cannot see it at [[advantage]].
