Resistance means to halve the incoming damage from a certain damage source (rounding down).

Good house-rule: I think having resistance have further implications outside of explicitly taking damage is cool. Cold resistance should give you advantage on constitution checks for [[exhaustion]] in cold climates; stuff like that.
