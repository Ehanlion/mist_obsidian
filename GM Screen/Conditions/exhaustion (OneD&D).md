Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
# Description:

The new system of exhaustion introduced by ONEDND is ruled as follows. I think it is both harsher and more forgiving than the original exhaustion system.
# Mechanics:
For every level of exhaustion a player has, they gain a -1 modifier to all d20 rolls. Yes, that means attacks, saves, checks -- anything that requires a d20 to roll you gain this negative modifier to. 

If at any point you exceed 10 levels of exhaustion (with 10 levels being the maximum) your character instantly and fully dies. 

A player can remove one level of exhaustion per long rest that they take. 10 levels of exhaustion means you need 10 long rests to fully remove it.
