Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]

This note will add information about how to use spell books and spells scrolls. These are a core part of the wizard class and since [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] is a wizard, this will probably help out monitoring these mechanics for them. 
#### A note on spell ink:
Spell ink is creatable. Refer to the Spell Ink crafting recipes in [[Potions with Alchemist's Supplies]]. One vial of spell ink can cover ONE spell of appropriate level. Wizards are going to need A LOT of ink.

# Copying a New Spell:
A wizard, or anyone who's class is built around using a spell book for their spells, can copy new spells NOT gained from gaining a level into their spell book for a certain cost. 

**To copy a spell into the spell book, the player must spend TWO HOURS PER SPELL LEVEL and 50 GOLD PER SPELL LEVEL. The ALSO must make a DC 10 + Spell Level Arcana check to be able to succeed.**

Note that the cost is mostly from magical spell ink, if you have a way to make spell ink, you can subvert the gold cost but the time cost is always going to be paid. You also must make an Arcana check. This check is made as you begin copying. If you fail, you salvage your time and material components but the spell scroll is destroyed.

The spell scroll, if you are copying from a spell scroll is destroyed if you copy from it to your spell book. This happens whether or not you succeed or your Arcana check, meaning that copying always destroys the spell scroll you copy from. 
# Copying a Spell Book You Made:
Now what about copying the entire spell book to make a back-up? This is possible AND it is cheaper than copying a new spell like above into the book. Wizards will want to do this in case their spell book gets lost or something.

**To copy a spell book you have already made, the player must spend only ONE HOUR PER SPELL LEVEL and 10 GOLD PER SPELL LEVEL.** 

Note that this is cheaper BUT you have to do it for every single spell you have in the book to make a copy, so this gets REALLY pricey really fast. 
# Making a Spell Scroll:
I think making a spell scroll should require the same resources and time that it takes to copy a new spell into your spell book.

**Creating a spell scroll costs TWO HOURS PER SPELL LEVEL and 50 GOLD PER SPELL LEVEL to create a spell scroll.**

# Using a Spell Scroll:
To use a spell scroll, the spell on the scroll MUST be a spell you can cast as your class. If it is not, you cannot read the spell scroll. Using a spell scroll cost the amount of time the spell normally does. After casting, the scroll is destroyed. Interrupting casting does NOT destroy the scroll. 

If the spell is of a higher level than you are able to cast, you must make a DC 10 + Spell's Level Arcana check. On a fail, the scroll is destroyed and the spell fades from it.

**The following describes the stats of any spell scroll:**
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table. Regardless of the creator's stats, the spell table below shows the scroll's Save DC and Attack Bonus.

|Spell Level|Rarity|Save DC|Attack Bonus|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cantrip|Common|13|+5|
|1st|Common|13|+5|
|2nd|Uncommon|13|+5|
|3rd|Uncommon|15|+7|
|4th|Rare|15|+7|
|5th|Rare|17|+9|
