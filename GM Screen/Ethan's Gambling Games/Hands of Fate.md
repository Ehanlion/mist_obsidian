	Then roll a 1d6 and keep it secret.
	Repeat the process for 1d4.

# Augmenting the Game:
Players can choose to play with higher faced dice, with popular options being 1d12, 1d10, and 1d8 (This variant is called Diamond Hands of Fate). It is uncommon to play this game with more than 4 dice because then statistics start to overcome luck of the rolls.
