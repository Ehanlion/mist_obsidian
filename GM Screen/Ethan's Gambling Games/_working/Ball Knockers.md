Game system: [[D&D Optional Mechanics]]
# Description:
Ball knockers is essentially the fantasy variant of pool. It can be played in duos or singles and the game variants have very different rules. 
### Rules from Reddit

### My Changes:
- **Vary the required shot:** You can blindly choose which shot to take between regular, trick, or power OR you can use investigation or perception to analyze which is best. The GM rolls a d4 for each teams turn to decide which shot is best: 1 = regular, 2 = trick,  3 = power, 4 = all. If you choose to take a shot that is not the best, the DCs for events increases by 5.
- **Duos:** Leaves a lot of room for cheating. It is naturally part of the game. The person not taking the shot can mess with the other team OR look to see if the enemy is messing with them.
