> Tamora was a devilish pirate who worked for merchants. She sailed the north seas, protecting trade routes. It became easy money if she could corral the merchant captains into a game of Twisted Twenty, after all the money flowed free after successful voyages. Soon the game was passed on and it became known after its creator, Tamora.
