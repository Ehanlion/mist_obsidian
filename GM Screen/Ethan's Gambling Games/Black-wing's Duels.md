**Description:**
This game is similar to poker in how it works. Players roll d6's, concealing their results and attempt to bid up their opponents, re-roll dice, and get the best set of dice before revealing to their opponents. 

**Rules**:
-  Start by buying in with the ante, usually 10 GP or more for Black-wing's Duels. 
-  Start by rolling 3d6 in front of you, keep the results hidden.
-  Each player rolls a d6, the highest goes first. If their is a tie, roll again between the people tied for the highest, etc.
-  Play starts with bidding. You can bid up an amount equal to the ante. (e.g. if the ante was 10 GP, you could bid or raise by 10 GP or more). 
-  As play continues players can fold, call, or re-raise. If you re-raise, you must bid at least double the prior raise. (e.g. if the player before you raised a game who's ante is 10 GP, by 15 GP, you could re-raise by 30 GP or more).
-  *The most important rule: you can re-roll any number of dice that you have when YOU raise or re-raise. e.g. I could re-roll 2 of by 3 dice down to try to get something better.* This means it is good to raise to gamble for better dice. 

**The Game in Initiative:**
-  If you wish to cheat, you may do it on your turn in choosing to fold, call or raise/re-raise. 
-  You can take an action OR bonus action to perform some trick on your turn by not both. 
-  You could supplant this with a perception check or insight check if you think someone else is cheating. This would count as your action.
-  The fold, call, and raise/re-raise as well as rolling the dice count as your free action to make cheating more viable.
