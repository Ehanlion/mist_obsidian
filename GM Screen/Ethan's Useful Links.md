# List of Links
What follows is a list of sources that I found as I worked on this adventure. The range is diverse and spanning..
1. [Great Git-Hub based bestiary](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/) - Excellent source for some weird to find monsters here. 
2. [Skill Challenges and Tension](https://www.optionalrule.com/2021/01/03/progressive-failures-and-rising-tension-in-5th-edition/) - source that teaches how to run skill challenges with a progressive check system, allowing for failures and innovation in the moment. 
3. [Ideas for more combat interactions and weird combats](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/orc5a3/what_are_fun_elements_that_can_be_added_to_combat/)
