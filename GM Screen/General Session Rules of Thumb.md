General session idea was a mass combat with prep. Lots of NPCs that were controlled.
- Need AOE to deal with massive groups of enemies
	- Not necessarily spells/abilities but things to interact with as well
- Bigger combats are better much later, but less so earlier because less resources
- Controlling NPCs much stronger feels terrible
	- Why are the player characters the adventurers if the NPCs are crazy stronger
	- Felt like Attack, that's it, Attack, that's it and repeat and repeat
- Combat idea from a Souls-like:
	- You have to kill an enemy before more of its kind comes
- The combat was good overall and the prep part was very good
	- The prep mattering was good
