Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
# Description:
If a spell must be maintained with concentration the following are the rules that govern that:
-  The spell determines if it is, in fact, a concentration spell and the maximum duration you can hold concentration on it before the spell ends.
-  You can end concentration at any time without expending an action.
-  The following are the things that can break your concentration:
	-  You cast another spell requiring concentration (you can only concentrate on one spell at any given time)
	-  You take damage. Succeed on a constitution saving throws versus DC 10 or half the damage taken (rounded down), whichever is higher.
	-  You are [[incapacitated]].
	-  An enormous distraction occurs (e.g. a huge wave crashing into you), required a success on a DC 10 constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.
