Make a perception check or an investigation check to search for something. (Maybe you are looking for an invisible creature, perception, or are looking for a key that got dropped, investigation.)

Good home-rule: I like to let players make 'searches' as free actions since they make combat feel a little smoother. Refer to [[what a turn looks like]] for the actual rules.
