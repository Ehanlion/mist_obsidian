Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
# Description:
To get to long jump, you must first move 10+ feet towards the point you wish to jump from. You can then horizontally jump a number of feet equal to your strength *score* (not modifier, your score).

**Jumping further**:
-  less than or equal to 10 feet over your base long jump: DC 14 Athletics check.
-  more than 10 feet over your base long jump: DC 20 Athletics check.

Failing this check will cause you to miss the target you are jumping to and either fall [[prone]], if you are jumping over a surface, or you will just grab the ledge you are targeting if you are jumping across a void (requiring half your movement speed to pull yourself up, like [[prone]] for standing up; if you lack this movement you are left dangling).

You can exert yourself to jump further as detailed in [[extended jumps]] rules.
