Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
# Description:
To get to high jump, you must first move 10+ feet towards the point you wish to jump from. You can jump vertically a number of feet equal to your strength modifier plus your proficiency bonus (by RAW it is just +3, but I like it scaling with proficiency instead). If you do not more 10+ feet first, you can jump only half this distance.

Good home-rule: I like the idea that doing this allows you to *reach* your high jump height + a number of feet based on your size:
-  Small size: +4 feet.
-  Medium size: +6 feet.
-  Large size: +8 feet.
-  Huge size: +10 feet.

You can pull yourself up from where you jump to (this is if your high jump doesn't take you above the height you want to jump) with half your movement, like the [[prone]] condition. If you lack the movement, you dangle in the air.

Furthermore, you *can* [[attack]] with you attack action while you jump like this, if choosing to hit a higher up target, but the attack rolls are made at [[disadvantage]].

You can exert yourself to jump further as detailed in [[extended jumps]] rules.
