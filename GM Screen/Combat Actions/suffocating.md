You can hold you breath for a number of minutes equal to 1+ your constitution modifier. 
**What can make you lose your breath?**
-  I like to play that damage taken while holding your breath might cause you to lose your breath and suffocate. Players make a constitution save versus DC 10 or half the damage taken (whichever is higher). If they fail, they cough and exhale their breath and begin to suffocate. 

**Can you regain breath?**
-  By RAW, no.
-  I like the idea that someone can breath into a suffocating players mouth to give them some of their air. A player wishing to donate air makes a slight of hand check, DC 15. If they succeed. They split their air between them and their target. If they fail, they also lose all of their breath and begin to suffocate. 

**Okay, I've run out of air, what now?**
-  If you run out of breath, you are now 'choking'.
-  You can survive a number of rounds equal to your constitution modifier (minimum one round).
-  Once your rounds of 'choking' without breath expire, you fall to 0 hit points and are considered [[unconscious]]. Each consecutive turn that you are at 0 hit points now, fail one [[death saving throw]]. 
	-  Note: You CANNOT become [[stable]] until you can breath again or get air into your system.
