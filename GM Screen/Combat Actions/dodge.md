Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
# Description:
**Until the start of your next turn:**
- Attacks made against you have [[disadvantage]] if you can see the attacker. 
- You make dexterity saving throws with [[advantage]] if you can see the effect forcing the save. 

If you become [[incapacitated]] or speed drop to zero (e.g. [[grappled]], [[paralyzed]], [[petrified]], [[stunned]]) you lose the effects of dodge.
