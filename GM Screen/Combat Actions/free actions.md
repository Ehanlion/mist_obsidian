During combat, players take their normal action, bonus actions, and movement. They also get one reaction per turn. However, a lot of interactions with combat environments feel like they should need additional interactions with them. These are classified as **free combat actions.**

Free actions are ruled as follows:
1. Free actions are classified by requiring additional ability checks to perform things. Talking and such is NOT part of a free action. 
2. A player can only make one ability check using a given ability score per turn. E.g. a player cannot make BOTH a slight of hand check and a stealth check as free actions because they are both based off of dexterity.
3. A player can take up two free actions requiring ability checks within one turn.
