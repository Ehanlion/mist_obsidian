Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
# Description:
You wait for a particular circumstance before you act, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn. 
**How the reaction can be used**:
-  You must choose a trigger that will cause you to use your reaction. This is done ahead of time when you use the ready action.
-  You must also choose a *reaction* that you take in response to this trigger. 
-  If you choose to cast a spell, it must have a casting time of one action and you hold [[concentration]] on that spell until it is used as part of the reaction. (if it is NOT used, it fizzles and you lose the slot you cast the spell with)
