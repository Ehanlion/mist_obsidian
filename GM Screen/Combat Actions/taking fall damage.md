Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
# Mechanic:
A player takes 1d6 for each 10 feet fallen, rounding up the feet fallen (15 ft fallen would equate to 2d6 damage).
# Reducing Fall Damage:
I like the idea that a player can use their reaction to halve the incoming fall damage by making either an **acrobatics** or **athletics** check. The DC gets set by the distance fallen. If the distance is below 50 feet the DC is 15 but if the distance is above 50 feet the DC is 20.
