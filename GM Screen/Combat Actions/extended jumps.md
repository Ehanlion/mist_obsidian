Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
# Description:
Jumping is limited by your strength score as dictated in the [[high jump]] and [[long jump]] rule sets. However, it makes sense for a character to be able to attempt an **athletics** or **acrobatics** check versus a DC in order to jump further.

	To jump further: DC = 5 + # Feet over max, rounded up to nearest 5.

Notes: The DC should increase in orders of 5. This is based on standard DND movement being blocked by 5's. Jumping 4 feet is equivalent to jumping 5 and jumping 6 is equivalent to jumping 10 feet.
