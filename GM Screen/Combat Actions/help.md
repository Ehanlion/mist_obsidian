**Things you can do to help a creature**:
-  You help one creature with a task, giving that creature [[advantage]] on the next ability check it makes for that task. 
-  You distract an enemy creature withing 5 feet of you, giving the next attack roll an ally makes against that creature [[advantage]]. 
-  This costs your action unless otherwise stated.

The [[advantage]] gained from help disappears once it is used (one-time usage), or your turn starts.
