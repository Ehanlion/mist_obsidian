**Here is what, by RAW, a turn looks like:**
-  Move up to your movement speed.
-  Take ONE action.
-  Take ONE bonus action.
-  Communicate with speech, gestures, or both.
-  Interact with ONE object or feature as you move or use you action. Anything past this requires you to use the [[use an object]] action. You may replace this part of your turn with a free ability check, where you take the equivalent of a free [[search]] action. 

This is fucking stupid. All due respect. Never change the Movement + Action + Bonus Action part, it is essential and the single, core function of D&D combat. *However*, the environment interaction is terrible. I think free actions should be free. Make a perception check, interact with an unlocked door, and hop in a minecart and push it; sure, that sounds cool! The only thing I would do is just don't duplicate parts of this. Don't let a player make 15 perception checks and abuse this lenience.
