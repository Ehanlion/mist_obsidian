*By RAW the rules are very bullshit IMHO. It is very easy to get away with low level counterspell casts against high level spells. It should be more difficult when there is a huge gap in spell casting level BUT should rewards closing that gap with higher level counterspell casts.*
# The 'Raw' Ruling:
From the RAW instructions, the DC for counterspell, *regardless of the level you counterpsll at, so long as it is lower than the level of the spell you are trying to counterspell*, if DC 10 + Level of the spell being countered. The check is made with your spellcasting ability modifier (no proficiencies added, just your modifier.)

# The Home-brewed Ruling:
I prefer the following ruleset:
-  If you counterspell at or above the level of the casted spell then the counterspell succeeds, no roll needed.
-  If you counterspell below the level of the casted spell you need to roll:
	-  The DC = DC 12 + 2 x (Level of casted spell - Level of your counterspell)
	-  This rewards higher level counterspell casts and punishes trying to cast counterspell as the lowest possible level against super powerful spells. 
-  You still make the check with just your spell casting modifier as before.
