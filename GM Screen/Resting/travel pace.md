Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]

Travel pace determines the speed at which a group can move through a large world. If they wish to stay together, the group is limited by their slowest member. 

**Slow Pace**:
-  Per Minute: 200 feet.
-  Per Hour: 2 miles.
-  Per Day: 16 miles.
-  Advantages: The group is able to roll a stealth check to stealthily move.

**Moderate Pace**:
-  Per Minute: 300 feet.
-  Per Hour: 3 miles.
-  Per Day: 24 miles.

**Fast Pace**:
-  Per Minute: 400 feet.
-  Per Hour: 4 miles.
-  Per Day: 32 miles.
-  Disadvantages: -5 penalty to passive perceptions scores. Easier to track. Refer to [[setting a tracking DC]]. Travelling fast should give -5 to the tracking DC. 

One day of travel is considered 8 hours. If a group wishes to push past this, they can choose to do so. However, the following day they will suffer the potential effects of [[exhaustion]]. The DC should be set according to the terrain and additional time travelled. Refer to the additional rules I added to the exhaustion page.
