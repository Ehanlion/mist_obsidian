[Excellent source on heavily obscuring and combat](https://arcaneeye.com/mechanic-overview/heavily-obscured-5e/#:~:text=The%20Basics%20of%20Heavily%20Obscured%20Areas%20in%20D%26D%205e,-In%20D%26D%205e&text=When%20in%20an%20area%20considered,their%20attack%20rolls%20have%20disadvantage.) 

**Effect**
-  Vision is totally blocked, creatures are effectively [[blinded]]. This means attacks they make are made at [[disadvantage]] and attacks made against them are done at [[advantage]]. 

**Examples**
-  Darkness without Darkvision
-  opaque, dense fog
-  dense foliage

**Creatures that are heavily obscured:**
A heavily obscured creature is considered invisible to targets looking at it, provided the target is within a heavily obscured area. 

### What Causes an Area to be Heavily Obscured in D&D?

Dealing with a heavily obscured area is actually quite a common occurrence in D&D 5e. Here are the most common situations in which you’ll run into it:

- **Darkness:** Whether by the _darkness, shadow of moil_, or _hunger of hadar_ spells, or merely a lack of light, being in full darkness without a light source or darkvision causes the area to be heavily obscured.
- **“Cloud” Effects:** _Fog cloud, stinking cloud,_ or just some bad weather are common ways to reduce vision and are enough to send a battlefield into chaos.
- **Being Invisible:** Funnily enough, being [[invisible]] in D&D technically grants you the benefits of being heavily obscured from others.
