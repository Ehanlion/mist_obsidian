Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]

# Description:
Sometime you may find that you have to attack a creature that is [[invisible]] or [[heavily obscured]]. This can be challenging, so here are some of my go-to rulings for this:
1. Anything requiring 'a target you can see fails'
2. Anything requiring 'a point you can see' fails if the area is obscured -- you can't see a point, only obscurity.
3. Two creatures attacking each other whilst [[heavily obscured]] attack normally, provided they can find each other.
4. To find an [[invisible]] or [[heavily obscured]] requires a perception check at disadvantage. 
5. Darkvision has no bearing if a [[heavily obscured]] is obscured in something other than darkness. 
6. If a character wishes to target an unseen creature, they do so at [[disadvantage]] -- don't tell them they **missed** only that they **didn't hit** -- it can be important to not reveal a hidden targets location.
