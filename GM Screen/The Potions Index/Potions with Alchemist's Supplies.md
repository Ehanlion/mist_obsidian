# Common Potion Recipes, DC 10:
>These potions were all originally common and they only cost 30 minute of your time and 25 GP to craft. 
#### Alchemist's Fire
This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged Attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon.

On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

	Ingredients: Fire Peas, Flask of Oil
#### Bottled Breath
This bottle contains a breath of elemental air. When you inhale it, you either exhale it or hold it.

If you exhale the breath, you gain the effect of the gust of wind spell. If you hold the breath, you don’t need to breathe for 1 hour, though you can end this benefit early (for example, to speak). Ending it early doesn’t give you the benefit of exhaling the breath.

	Ingredients: Air elemental wisp
#### Blasting Powder
This volatile alchemical powder comes in a small pouch. When ignited by an open flame or a fuse, the powder explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding pouch must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A character can bind multiple pouches of blasting powder together so they explode at the same time. Each additional pouch increases the damage by 1d6 (maximum of 10d6) and the blast radius by 5 feet (maximum of 20 feet).

	Ingredients: Flame Lily, Charcoal
#### Fake Blood
Crafted from bloodroot and infused with small quantities of powdered iron, this concoction looks, smell and even tastes the same as the real deal. An investigation of 15 or higher or any level of identification magic reveals its true nature.

	Ingredients: Bloodroot
#### Grenade, smoke
As an action, a character can throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. With a grenade launcher, the character can propel the grenade up to 120 feet away.

One round after a smoke grenade lands, it emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area in a 20-foot radius. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.

	Ingredients: Flame Lily, Frost Lichen
#### Ink, Spell Writing (common)
1 ounce bottle used in the writing of spells. Can be used for Level 1-3 spells, both for scrolls and in books.

	Ingredients: Charcoal
#### Potion of Climbing
When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and grey layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.

	Ingredients: Giant Wolf Spider Hair, Skulk Claw
#### Potion of Swimming
The potion is made of layers of teal, light blue, and indigo fluid that resemble a deep ocean. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.

When you drink this potion, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to swim.

	Ingredients: Quipper Scale (x3)
#### Soothsalts
Soothsalts are derived from a naturally occurring crystalline. Soothsalts are consumed orally in lozenge-sized doses, and frequent users can be identified by the telltale crimson stain around their mouths. A creature subjected to a dose of sooths-alts gains advantage on all Intelligence checks for 1d4 hours.

For each dose of sooth-salts consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion—an effect which is cumulative with multiple doses.

Sooth-salts may be worth as much as 150 gp to the right buyer, but is often illegal to trade.

	Ingredients: Sooth-salt Geode

# Rare Potion Recipes, DC 15:
>These potions cost 30 minutes of your time. The gold cost is variable. The first chunk of potions here were originally 'uncommon' potions and they only cost 100 GP. The second chunk of potions here were originally 'rare' potions and they cost 400 GP. So make sure to get the correct cost when asking for the gold to make the potion.
# 100 GP POTIONS:
>These are potions that were originally uncommon potions so they cost less.
#### Ink, Spell Writing (Uncommon)
1 ounce bottle used in the writing of spells. Can be used for Level 4-6 spells, both for scrolls and in books.

	Ingredients: Charcoal, finely ground iron
#### Invisible Ink
1 ounce bottle of ink that can only be made visible with spells, traits or items that see the invisible, or by applying a mild acid.

	Ingredients: Pixie's Parasol, Ink
#### Lesser Potion of Mana
Vibrant blue and deeply purple, studded with dots of white and silver, this potion reminds of the night sky. When agitated, it lets out a soft, purple light. After drinking this potion, a player can regain 1d4 worth of spell slots levels. If you drink more than one, make a DC Constitution save of DC 13 + 1 for the amount of potions you've drank above 1 e.g. drank 3 potions, DC = 13 + 2. 

	Ingredients: Pixie’s Parasol, Silverthorn
#### Midnight Oil
When the midnight oil is used to light a lantern, it emits bright light for 5 feet and dim light a further 5 feet for 8 hours. If a creature stays in the light emitted by this oil for the full 8 hours, they get all the benefits of a long rest without needing to sleep, provided they only engage in light activity such as reading, studying, talking, etc.

This does have consequences. If you do this for more than 2 times in a row without a true long rest in between, you start to hallucinate. For every time you undergo this effect after the first 2 times, roll a Charisma save with DC 13 + 1 per midnight oil rest above 2. On a fail, you gain a madness.

	Ingredients: Flask of Oil, Pixie's Parasol
#### Oil of Slipperiness
This oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours. Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.

	Ingredients: Flask of Oil, Crawler Mucus, Water Elemental Droplet
#### Pixie Dust
As an action, you can sprinkle this dust on yourself or another creature you can see within 5 feet of you. The recipient gains a flying speed of 30 feet and the ability to hover for 1 minute. If the creature is airborne when this effect ends, it falls safely to the ground, taking no damage and landing on its feet. A small packet holds enough pixie dust for one use.

	Ingredients: Rainbow Mushroom, Eagle’s Feather
#### Potion of Animal Friendship
Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair. When you drink this potion, you can cast the Animal Friendship spell (DC 13 Wisdom saving throw) for 1 hour at will.

	Ingredients: Cat’s tongue, Quipper Scale
#### Potion of Fire Breath
After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed. This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.

	Ingredients: Ashblossom, Fire Elemental Ember
#### Potion of Growth
When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.

	Ingredients: Sourgrass, Everfrost Berry, Giant Wolf Spider Hair

The DM determines the nature and duration of these visions.
