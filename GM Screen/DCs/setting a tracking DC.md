# Description:
Guidelines for setting a DC to track a target. 

*Set the base DC using the type of surface that was being travelled over*:
-  **Soft surface, like Snow or Sand**: DC 10
-  **Temperate surface, like Dirt or Grass**: DC 15
-  **Hard surface, like Stone**: DC 20

*Now modify the DC base on additional conditions*:
-  **Each day since tracked creature passed**: +5 to DC
-  **If it is Raining**: +3 to DC
-  **If it is Storming**: +5 to DC 
-  **Creature left an obvious trail**: -5 to DC

*Now further modify the DC based on the creature's knowledge of the surrounding and its basic  proficiencies:*
-   **Creature prof. in Nature/Survival**: +3 to DC
-  **Creature NOT prof. in Nature/Survival**: -3 to DC
-  **Creature prof. in Stealth:** + 1 to DC
-  **Creature NOT prof. in Stealth**: -1 to DC

*Now factor in the creature's intelligence to the equation (if you really want to be thorough)*
**Add intelligence to the total**:
-  This is a weird stat to add, but it makes sense; a more intelligent creature, regardless of proficiencies will think harder about how to escape cleverly.
	-  Check the creatures intelligence *modifier* (not the score, the modifier e.g. +1, +3 etc.)
	-  If that modifier is above +2, add the modifier - 2 to the DC
	-  if that modifier is 2 or below, subtract the abs. value of the modifier from the DC. 
		-  e.g. modifier of -1, subtract 1 from DC, modifier of +1, subtract 1 from the DC.
		-  DC - |modifier|
