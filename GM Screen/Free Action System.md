# Proposed Action System:
1. Action
2. Bonus Action
3. **Swift Action 1**
5. Movement
6. Reaction
# Swift Actions:
Free actions can be interactions with the environments or just simply checks.
#### Actions that are now Swift Actions:
1. Object Interaction
2. Search
#### List of Swift Actions:
1. **Search** - Make an investigation check to look for something close OR make a perception check to search for something afar. Search for a healing potion in a cluttered workbench (investigation) or search for a hidden target (perception).
2. **Recall** - Make a history check to recall information.
3. **Analyze Target** - Make an insight check on a target to see if they are close to running or scared. Could also be used to determine a creatures next possible target.
4. **Exchange Item** - Draw an item and replace an item you are holding with that item. Stow the previously held item. 
5. **Object Interaction** - Interact with an object in the environment. 
6. **Take Better Cover** - Augment what cover you have. If you are behind half or three-quarters cover, increase your AC by 1. If you have at least half your movement when you do this, increase your AC by 2 instead.  

Very important to note, you can be creative -- in fact, it is encouraged. Players need to feel free to suggest a swift action to take and the gm should do their best to allow it. Obviously you cannot use anything explicitly labelled as an action e.g. another attack, casting a spell, etc. But this is a players chance to get creative in combat. 

# More Actions:
1. **Shove** - Make an athletics check contested by a targets athletics or acrobatics (they choose). Being a size large grants advantage and being a size smaller grants disadvantage. Shove fails if the target is more than one size larger that you. If you succeed, a target is pushed 5 feet or knocked prone.
2. **Disarm** - Make an athletics check contested by a targets athletics or acrobatics (they choose). Being a size large grants advantage and being a size smaller grants disadvantage. If you succeed, a target drops an item it is holding (creature disarming chooses). 
3. **Ready** - Take something requiring one action and ready it. Decide what triggers it. The trigger must be external and perceivable. Readying a spell forces concentration to be held. Burning a readied action costs your reaction. 
# More Bonus Actions:
1. **Dart** - Move rapidly and nimbly, causing opportunity attacks made against you to have disadvantage. 
2. **Hustle** - Immediately move up to half your speed, rounded down. 
3. **Juke** - Gain a +1 bonus to dexterity saving throws and to your AC until the start of your next turn.
# More Movement:
1. **Hold Ground** - You must use your full movement to perform this. Your speed becomes zero. You gain advantage on check and saves against being forcefully moved. This ends if you are moved.
2. **Jump** - Jumping works as normal. If you wish to jump beyond your base jump distances, you can make an athletics check. You cannot exceed your speed on a turn e.g. if you can jump 20 feet, but have 10 feet of movement 
# More Reactions:
1. **Arrest Fall**- Make a DC 15 acrobatics check to half falling damage you are going to take.
2. **Water Dive** - Falling into water is more forgiving. Take no damage for 20 feet, and half damage for another 20 feet, with all remaining distance taking normal damage. Make a DC 15 acrobatics check to half this damage falling into water. If you are diving deliberately, make this check with advantage. If you are restrained or restricted, make this check with disadvantage. 
3. **Edge Grab** - If you are falling, attempt to grab an edge. Make a Dexterity saving throw. Normal surface: DC 13. Rough surface: DC 10. Slick surface: DC 18. 
4. **Shield Block** - If you wield a shield you can reduce incoming damage by your strength modifier + shield's bonus to AC. 
5. **Step** - Step 5 feet after an attack is made against you. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. 

# Just Additional things for combat:
1. **Flanking** - If a friendly creature 'flanks' a target, that is to say they stand opposite a target to you, you gain advantage on your attacks against the target. 
2. **Cover** - You can gain protection from attacks by darting behind protection. You can have no cover, half-cover, or three-quarters cover. Half-cover adds 2 to AC, three-quarters cover gives +5 to AC and advantage on dexterity saving throws.
