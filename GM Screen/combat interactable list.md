#### Reddit list:
- Dock cranes, especially while it's carrying a load that can be set swinging.
- Passing carts or carriages.
- Random pools of mud or urine that create slippery ground.
- Giant-slug slime trail that creates a slip'n'slide.
- Open sewers or other random pits of unpleasantness.  
- Crates, stalagmites, or other obstruction that small creatures can duck through.
- Slopes with rubble, scree, or other items that cause people to slide.
- Shelves that can be pushed over.
- Unstable stalactites or poorly stored goods in high places, that can be released on people.
- Stacks of rope, or in nastier situations: corpses, that can lead to entangled feet.
- Large braziers that can be knocked over/have people thrown into it.
- In large cave systems: tunnels or large sink-holes occasionally have huge gusts of wind or water blow out of them; for absolute cartoonishness: the locals know the exact timings so can jump down one hole and pop up another.
- Giant fermentation vats to drop people into (where they probably drown since there's usually a thick layer of CO_2 over those), or crack open causing a beer flood.
- Crystal formations that refract or focus light that can generate "'frickin laser beams" or blinding flashes of light if light sources or light based spells are placed appropriately, or at arbitrary times during the day on the surface.
- Giant cogs, steam boilers (periodically blasting clouds of steam), and conveyor belts for the usual gnomish madness.
- Related to above: giant cogs, chains, wheels, for your operating mill, or clock. People can stand (or be thrown onto them) to get moved, just ... don't get dragged into the cogs.
- Giant mill hammers.
- Huge peaceful creatures that will just try to stay out of the way unless hurt, in which case they'll rampage.
