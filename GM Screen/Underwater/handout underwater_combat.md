**Spellcasting Underwater**
While submerged underwater and holding its breath, a creature can cast a spell that requires a verbal component with a casting time of a reaction, bonus action, or action. After casting the spell, If the creature can’t breathe underwater, it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or loses one minute of breath. If a creature can breathe underwater it cannot lose breath from casting a spell underwater since it can breathe. 

**Swimming**
A creature lacking a swim speed treats moving through water as difficult terrain. 

**Holding Breath Underwater**
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). A player should track this with a number at the top of their character sheet. Each round is 6 seconds, so track this accordingly. For example, a creature with a 16 Con score has 4 minutes of breath or 40 rounds worth of breath. 

Every time a player uses an action, bonus action, reaction, or movement beyond their normal movement or casts a spell (refer to Spellcasting Underwater), they lose one turn of breathing underwater. Furthermore, for each instance of damage a creature takes, they lose one rounds worth of breath. If at any point this reduces the number of turns left for breathing to zero, refer to running out of air below. 

**Losing Breath Underwater**
When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again. The creatures makes death saving throws as normal, with the caveat that it cannot be stable until it can breathe again. If the creature can breath underwater, they can become stable underwater just like they would normally.
