Rules Index: [[D&D Game Mechanics]]
# Note about Water:
Water feels more and more like just falling onto stone the higher up you fall from. Players diving from insane heights should expect to take damage hitting the water. Of course there is some leniency from the later section on calculating the damages. 
# Mechanics:
Tasha's rulings allow players to **use their reaction** to make either a DC 15 Athletics or DC 15 Acrobatics check to halve the damage of impact going into the water. If a player **is choosing to dive into the water,** make this check with [[advantage]], otherwise make it straight. If a player is [[restrained]] in any way, either make the checks at [[disadvantage]] or don't make it at all and they auto fail. 

Furthermore, if a player has a swimming speed, you have resistance to the damage incurred from falling into water. You can have resistance from swimming speed and then succeed on the reaction check for diving to effectively quarter the incoming damage.
# Calculating Fall Damage into Water:
For the first 20 feet fallen towards the water, no damage is taken. For the next 20 feet of falling, the damage gets halved. The rest is rolled normally.
