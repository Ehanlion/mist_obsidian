Diving into water is just as bad as diving into the ground. There is some leniency here however. 

For the first 20 feet, no damage is taken. The next 20 feet sees the damage halved. The rest is normal.

Tasha's rulings allow players to use their reaction to make either a DC 15 Athletics or DC 15 Acrobatics check to halve the damage of impact going into the water. If a player **is choosing to dive into the water,** make this check with [[advantage]], otherwise make it straight. If a player is [[restrained]] in any way, either make the checks at [[disadvantage]] or don't make it at all and they auto fail.
