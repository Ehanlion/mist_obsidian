#### Holding breath:
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

A player should track this with a number at the top of their character sheet.
#### Losing Breath:
Every time a player uses an action, bonus action, reaction, or movement beyond normal movement, as well as referring to [[casting a spell underwater]], they lost one turn of breathing underwater. If at any point this reduces the number of turns left for breathing to zero, refer to running out of air below. 
#### Running out of air:
When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it canâ€™t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again. It makes [[death saving throw]]s as normal with the exception that it cannot be stable until it is removed from the water.
