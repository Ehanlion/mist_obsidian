#### Holding breath:
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

#### Running out of air:
When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it canâ€™t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again. It makes [[death saving throw]]s as normal with the exception that it cannot be stable until it is removed from the water.
