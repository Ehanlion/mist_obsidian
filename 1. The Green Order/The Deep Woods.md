*The trees whisper and creak with the rushing of winds through the upper branches. You can hear the chirping of forest birds in the distance, the rustling of wildlife, and the pleasant odor of blooming flowers around the bases of the tall trees. The branches above you flow and sway in a calm fashion.*
