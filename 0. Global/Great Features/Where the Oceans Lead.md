An artifact of how [[The Aetherveil Projector]] function.

There are great seas surrounding Mist. Near the island, it makes sense that the depths of the sea is not too extreme.

However, as you sail beyond the island shallows, sailors have reported eerie feelings that the oceans seem to have no bottom at all. They would be right, just with no way of knowing it. If you were to travel down into the depths of the great seas, you would find that eventually you find yourself on [the elemental plane of water](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Plane_of_Water). You emerge at the depths of the plane and slowly, the deeper you swim, rise towards the surface of the plane. 

This occurrence is a error within the creation of [[The Aetherveil Projector]] and is not as designed.
