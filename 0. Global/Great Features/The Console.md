Regional Description: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: Centerpiece of [[Bunker 1xNWH]], in same room as [[The Aether-Veil Projector]]
# Description:
The CONSOLE room is a large, circular room. The room's centerpiece if [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] which is a series of connections to a large, floating orb of [[Stormphrax]]. This takes up the center column of the room's space (about 200 feet tall and 60 feet wide). The orb of [[Stormphrax]] floats halfway up in the column (about 100 feet up). At this level, scaffolding is built, suspended in the air over top of the shaft. (The shaft is wider than 60 feet, but there is a 60 feet section in the middle with no scaffolding built over it). On the scaffolding are built the CONSOLE control panels, with the panel for accepting the Keys ([[Shards]]) as inputs. The CONSOLE panels are unresponsive unless all eight Keys are inputted. At the back of the room is a large, 40 ft x 40 ft, room containing shelves of future plans as well as a holographic map of the island of Mist.

# The Map Room:
At the rear of the CONSOLE room is the Map room, where there is an interactable map of Mist. It displays locations, buildings, and structures that were created **by [[The Many]].** This means that the map is NOT up to date with how Mist looks but rather shows all of the important things to [[The Many]] labelled and show around the island. The text is all in Deep Speech, the language of [[The Many]]. 

A creature can interact with the map by physically touching the holographic output. Touching locations will bring up coordinate locations (similar to that used on a battleship grid) as well as simple descriptions of each location and the name of the head architect of that locations.
# The CONSOLE Panels:
The console physically implements the controls needed to manage all of the workings of [[The Aether-Veil Projector]]. These functions are detailed within the note for [[The Mist Codex]]. Each separate CONSOLE station handles a different part of [[The Mist Codex]]. Some CONSOLE stations are empty and have a bare top with no control because they were going to be implemented one day but they never were.
