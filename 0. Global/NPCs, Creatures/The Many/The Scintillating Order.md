Subsection: Pursuers of [[The Many]]
# Description
[[The Scintillating Order]] was the organization that ruled [[The Runewilds]]. It was headed by the Queen, who served as the groups leader as well as the Queen of the monarchy that rules [[The Runewilds]]. The Queen was an ordinary person but the members of [[The Scintillating Order]] were not; they were extraordinary mages, inventors, warriors, and fighters. However the group had a long-standing jealously of [[The Many]] who time and time again proved themselves a more inventive and superior group. It was probably then ego and pride of the scintillating order that drove them, under advisement from the Queen, to enslave [[The Many]]. 
# Motives:
The Scintillating order was the controlling force behind the success of [[The Runewilds]] and in their time with [[The Many]], they were able to solidify [[The Runewilds]] as the greatest, strongest society in the realms. 

The order is motivated by innovation, success, and power. They believe that to assert control over a people, they must demonstrate their innovation and creativeness to improving and perfecting the lives of their people. This means creating new cities, great weapons, and landscaping changes; anything necessary to ensure complete loyalty to the Order.

These motives drive the Order to 'recruit' (at great expense) any great mage or inventor that could help their cause. A rogue group of inventors and helpers of [[The Runewilds]] could damage the pristine reputation of The Order. If those who are asked to join refuse, The Order will revert to more sinister methods including murder, mind-slaving, and mind-erasure. The core principle of The Order may be to improve the lives of the people in [[The Runewilds]] but they do that in order to keep the devotion of the people. Anyone sundering this goal is seen as a target to The Order. 

For all of their time in power, The Order has been headed by The Queen (or in the past, the King) of [[The Runewilds]]. The monarchy always led the Order and in exchange, the Order was always completely loyal to the Monarchy. For in this relationship, perfect authority and power could be maintained over [[The Runewilds]].
