*An excerpt from the treatise* **The Mysteries of Mist I**.

"My findings surprised me. It is my succinct and firm conclusion that we are alone. Terribly, terribly alone. Ancient texts that I can date through the weave to millennia ago, tell tales of great beings called **[[The Prime Deities]]** and **[[The Betrayer Gods]]** who manipulated creatures from beyond the veil. They are keystones in our society but who are they? Do we worship them today, or just their memories? Do they exist still, or have they gone into slumber? I don't know. Their powers remain. Clerics, paladins, and the likes still follow the divinities. There is something missing. I've scoured detailed summoning circles, elaborate rituals, and bloody ceremonies to bring about the attention of these beings. Carefully, I have tried to replicate these. I have failed. One by one, they failed. They could not be completed."

"That brings me to the planes, for they are key to these ancient rites. The ancient texts say we must, and I quote, 'pass energy from the weave across planes to appease or feed the deities.' If the planes were blocked, the rites would fail. I am scared. The Fey, The Shadow fell, The Ethereal, The Astral: planes I long to see, described in ancient texts with unfathomable beauty, mystery, and magic, are lost. I could not open a portal to them. Something must be wrong. Something must be horribly wrong."

"Perhaps, with a catalyst, there could be a way to breach into the planes. More research is needed."

*This topic comes to a close with this passage. It is brief. There is no more elaboration in this book. The author had more, but you never read them.*
