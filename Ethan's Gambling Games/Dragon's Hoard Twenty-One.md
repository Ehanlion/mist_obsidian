**Description:**
This game follows similar rules to blackjack. It is played by rolling dice to see who can get closest to twenty-one, as the name suggest. Cheating *is* encouraged but discretion is advised. Normally this game is not played for money but rather for physical bets (a soul bartered for a soul is not too uncommon amongst the demons that invented the game).

**Rules**:
-  Start by rolling 2d10 in front of you; *keep them hidden from your opponent*
-  Each turn that passes, you can choose to hit e.g. to roll an *additional* d10 and add it to your sum
-  Important: 1's on the d10 can count as *either* a 1 or an 11 (similar to aces in blackjack).
-  The players each reveal their totals once both players have chosen to stand on what they have.
-  *Important: in the event of a tie, the CHALLENGER loses (e.g. it is more advantageous to BE challenged in this game than it is to challenge.*

**The Game in Initiative:**
-  More often than not, if both parties are cheating, the GM should have players roll initiative and play the game like its combat.
-  On your turn, hitting or standing (e.g. rolling another d10 or staying on what you have), is considered a free action as part of your turn.
-  You can take and action OR bonus action to perform some cheating on your turn (only one, not both for sake of rapidity)
