# Save the Newly Weds:
> Posting: Help a Grung down on luck. Need help finding wedding ring. Will teach cliff diving to help search for ring. Please, in the name of all that is slimy. 

**Asking NPCs:**
1. Gargle, green grung, excellent cliff diver
2. Dargah, blue grung, soon to be wife of Gargle but threatening to call off wedding if Gargle cannot get engagement ring back. 

Gargle can be found in the town center and will take the helper to the cliff's front. He lost the ring down the coast a little bit, maybe a couple miles, where he proposed to Dargah. The ring plummeted into the sea and the only way to get to it is to dive off the cliff. 

Gargle recommends bringing rope and climbing gear to get back up the cliff's face because there is not a way back up built where he lost the ring.
