# Formatting Side Quests
I want to keep this *very* well organized because it will track mini and even big side quest ideas throughout the entirety of campaign. This section will breakdown a good metric for organizing these mission, how to address them once run, an indicator of which session the mission was run during, and outcomes.

# Storage for Side Quest Ideas
### Old List from  [[Mission, Follow the Raiders, Part 2]]
**Cool hooks or ideas to seed in town:**
- [ ] Glimpses of Sahuaguin to high passive perception, tracking leads back to salvage yard. Some Sahuaguin are spying on the town. 
- [ ] Tax collector needs help with labor to go collect taxes, except everyone who is getting taxes collected should be getting a break from them since they lost loved one in the raids
	- [ ] make this discoverable be like "oh I already paid, I thought I was getting a break"
	- [ ] Have them work with crooked guards? 
- [ ] Igor and Dmitri were here, Dmitri went off to visit Livy's Livestock. Igor is in town still. Hear about this from a random tavern, maybe Chugga's or the brothel, love makes its way. 
	- [ ] This would be for Wake specifically, if they ask around have people refer them to bars or brothel or something idk
	- [ ] Arnov has seen them the day he is asked about it
	- [ ] They are actually in temple glade with Tennyson
- [ ] Monsters hunters needed in the Guildhall, group can choose to abandon their quest and go monster hunting instead.
	- Crews are here from island towns of:
		- [ ] [[The Port of Last Call]] - further east than other island towns
		- [ ] [[The Town of Frost-Haven]] - icy, cold town surrounded with icebergs far north
		- [ ] [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]] - right near [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]
- [ ] Deion can meet some old friends from [[Gandoras City]] at the Trading Post, since this is where the caravans pass through. Caravans have been having a rough time, the one currently in town is the last one since [[Gandoras City]] and the Trade Guild are shutting them down due to violence. 
	- [ ] good lead in for tales of happenings in widow makers stands or charmer royalties
	- [ ] Maybe have them recount sighting of Sahuaguin, which they thought was weird. 
- [ ] Rock-tenders need help levitating a ship, good chance for Kelswin to learn magic but not magic? 
	- [ ] Pitch this like a rock tender job opening is available
	- [ ] willing to train but must show magic ability
- [ ] Ship repair for a damaged pirate ship that sailed into town. Needs someone to help repair hull
	- [ ] Great way to learn about seas and  danged
	- [ ] Lots of knowledge about shrouds mist oceans etc.
- [ ] Help "Fishermen" (actually pirates) unload their "catch" (expensive, illicit goods) into town
	- [ ] Discrete, good face mission
	- [ ] Need to get goods off ship and smuggle them to a seller in town willing to pay mule fee
- [ ] The Other Way and [[Arnov Vasilov]] can help with the Mind Rock and some info about that. He can tell tales about the South east coast? Maybe allude to [[Ignel Valis]] as Sylvan Gile here? Just say like, oh powerful magic, knew a wizard from the coast who did that, name was Sylvan, Sylvan Gile or something.
	- [ ] good way to seed that SG is after powerful artifacts since maybe Arnov helped him?
	- [ ] DO NOT include a connection to NW because that would be leading towards SG = IV 
- [ ] People going missing in town, specifically those who have already lost loved ones. Connected to [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]] who are abducting people and sending them to [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]]. This connect to [[Dmitri Mironov]], who is gone from [[Gullhook]] because he is taking some abductees to [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] and [[Igor Larionov]] who is helping but is hiding out in [[Gullhook]]. 
	- [ ] [[Igor Larionov]] and [[Dmitri Mironov]] are helping because the slaves get shipped back to [[Fedorov's Legion]] or to [[The Sunken Caverns]] for [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], as per [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] orders. 
- [ ] Potion maker from Dozy Brewer's needs help getting ingredients from market 
	- [ ] hunt for specific alchemic ingredients and acquire them to get paid out
	- [ ] Also a change to learn bout potion brewing. 
	- [ ] Learn to use an alchemists, herbalists, or whatever kit or something 
- [ ] Brute and enforcer of private hand needed for sparring practice
	- [ ] Basically someone goes to be an expert dueler's target dummy?
# Basic Guidance for New Quests:

> [!NOTE] Notes on Side Quests from Players
> The biggest takeaway for side quests is that solo side questing, where players end up all feeling like they are forced to split up to get value, is not great. If you are going to create a side quest, make sure it has appeal to the *entire* party and not just one player. This way, *the entire party* feels like they can join in on just one quest. The rewards should be adjusted for this.
> 
> Say for instance, there are 4 small quests that pay out 1000 gp each, and one massive quest that appeals to everyone but pays 1500 gp. It is the player's nature to say "Hey, if we split, we can do 4 quests and get way more money, let's just do that."
> 
> There is even *another layer* to this whole debacle. Lets say the GM plans 4 *bigger* quests, that each pay now 5000 gp to give the group diversity on what mission to select. There is an issue here: it is likely that the players will say "hey we can, again, just do four bigger quests and get even more gold." Even if the players *vocally tell me they want bigger quests* they will, of course, take the opportunity to stack up as much gold as possible. 
> 
> It needs to be *very apparent* that a large quest demands a full party to journey on it; from a simple posting that says "four required for task X," to "large crew needed to audition for task Y," or simply "this quest is very dangerous, take your friends or you will die."

The ceremony, dedicated to the golden god [[Alsolace]], will take place in the sacred [[Temple Glade]] at sundown tomorrow. [[Dmitri Mironov]] is depicted as a figure of immense importance within the temple, a pillar of the religious community, tragically cut down by a fearsome entity known as the "Wraith of the Night."
