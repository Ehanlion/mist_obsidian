# Formatting Side Quests
I want to keep this *very* well organized because it will track mini and even big side quest ideas throughout the entirety of campaign. This section will breakdown a good metric for organizing these mission, how to address them once run, an indicator of which session the mission was run during, and outcomes.

# Storage for Side Quest Ideas
### Old List from  [[Quest to Chase the Raiders]]
**Cool hooks or ideas to seed in town:**
- [ ] Glimpses of Sahuaguin to high passive perception, tracking leads back to salvage yard. Some Sahuaguin are spying on the town. 
- [ ] Tax collector needs help with labor to go collect taxes, except everyone who is getting taxes collected should be getting a break from them since they lost loved one in the raids
	- [ ] make this discoverable be like "oh I already paid, I thought I was getting a break"
	- [ ] Have them work with crooked guards? 
- [ ] Igor and Dmitri were here, Dmitri went off to visit Livy's Livestock. Igor is in town still. Hear about this from a random tavern, maybe Chugga's or the brothel, love makes its way. 
	- [ ] This would be for Wake specifically, if they ask around have people refer them to bars or brothel or something idk
	- [ ] Arnov has seen them the day he is asked about it
	- [ ] They are actually in temple glade with Tennyson
- [ ] Monsters hunters needed in the Guildhall, group can choose to abandon their quest and go monster hunting instead.
	- Crews are here from island towns of:
		- [ ] [[The Port of Last Call]] - further east than other island towns
		- [ ] [[The Town of Frost-Haven]] - icy, cold town surrounded with icebergs far north
		- [ ] [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]] - right near [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]
- [ ] Deion can meet some old friends from [[Gandoras City]] at the Trading Post, since this is where the caravans pass through. Caravans have been having a rough time, the one currently in town is the last one since [[Gandoras City]] and the Trade Guild are shutting them down due to violence. 
	- [ ] good lead in for tales of happenings in widow makers stands or charmer royalties
	- [ ] Maybe have them recount sighting of Sahuaguin, which they thought was weird. 
- [ ] Rock-tenders need help levitating a ship, good chance for Kelswin to learn magic but not magic? 
	- [ ] Pitch this like a rock tender job opening is available
	- [ ] willing to train but must show magic ability
- [ ] Ship repair for a damaged pirate ship that sailed into town. Needs someone to help repair hull
	- [ ] Great way to learn about seas and  danged
	- [ ] Lots of knowledge about shrouds mist oceans etc.
- [ ] Help "Fishermen" (actually pirates) unload their "catch" (expensive, illicit goods) into town
	- [ ] Discrete, good face mission
	- [ ] Need to get goods off ship and smuggle them to a seller in town willing to pay mule fee
- [ ] The Other Way and [[Arnov Vasilov]] can help with the Mind Rock and some info about that. He can tell tales about the South east coast? Maybe allude to [[Ignel Valis]] as Sylvan Gile here? Just say like, oh powerful magic, knew a wizard from the coast who did that, name was Sylvan, Sylvan Gile or something.
	- [ ] good way to seed that SG is after powerful artifacts since maybe Arnov helped him?
	- [ ] DO NOT include a connection to NW because that would be leading towards SG = IV 
- [ ] People going missing in town, specifically those who have already lost loved ones. Connected to [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]] who are abducting people and sending them to [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]]. This connect to [[Dmitri Mironov]], who is gone from [[Gullhook]] because he is taking some abductees to [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] and [[Igor Larionov]] who is helping but is hiding out in [[Gullhook]]. 
	- [ ] [[Igor Larionov]] and [[Dmitri Mironov]] are helping because the slaves get shipped back to [[Fedorov's Legion]] or to [[The Sunken Caverns]] for [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], as per [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] orders. 
- [ ] Potion maker from Dozy Brewer's needs help getting ingredients from market 
	- [ ] hunt for specific alchemic ingredients and acquire them to get paid out
	- [ ] Also a change to learn bout potion brewing. 
	- [ ] Learn to use an alchemists, herbalists, or whatever kit or something 
- [ ] Brute and enforcer of private hand needed for sparring practice
	- [ ] Basically someone goes to be an expert dueler's target dummy?
# Basic Guidance for New Quests:

> [!NOTE] Notes on Side Quests from Players
> The biggest takeaway for side quests is that solo side questing, where players end up all feeling like they are forced to split up to get value, is not great. If you are going to create a side quest, make sure it has appeal to the *entire* party and not just one player. This way, *the entire party* feels like they can join in on just one quest. The rewards should be adjusted for this.
> 
> Say for instance, there are 4 small quests that pay out 1000 gp each, and one massive quest that appeals to everyone but pays 1500 gp. It is the player's nature to say "Hey, if we split, we can do 4 quests and get way more money, let's just do that."
> 
> There is even *another layer* to this whole debacle. Lets say the GM plans 4 *bigger* quests, that each pay now 5000 gp to give the group diversity on what mission to select. There is an issue here: it is likely that the players will say "hey we can, again, just do four bigger quests and get even more gold." Even if the players *vocally tell me they want bigger quests* they will, of course, take the opportunity to stack up as much gold as possible. 
> 
> It needs to be *very apparent* that a large quest demands a full party to journey on it; from a simple posting that says "four required for task X," to "large crew needed to audition for task Y," or simply "this quest is very dangerous, take your friends or you will die."

> [!NOTE] Quest Hook
> In the heart of town, a prominent notice catches the eye, detailing an upcoming grand funeral to honor the memory of a 'dear friend of [[Tennyson Heralds]],' the esteemed [[Dmitri Mironov]]. The ceremony, dedicated to the golden god [[Alsolace]], will take place in the sacred [[Temple Glade]] at sundown tomorrow. [[Dmitri Mironov]] is depicted as a figure of immense importance within the temple, a pillar of the religious community, tragically cut down by a fearsome entity known as the "Wraith of the Night."

#### To Hunt a Baby Kraken - **UNUSED** - `UNFINISHED`
- [ ] Check to indicated if the quest has been completed
- **Session first used in:**
- **Location used in:** 
> [!NOTE] Quest Hook - Mission Posting Variant
> **Wanted: Brave Souls to Hunt a Young Terror of the Deep**
>
A baby kraken has been wreaking havoc in the waters of [[The Distant Sea]], leaving destroyed ships and shattered lives in its wake. Two brave and desperate souls seek assistance in confronting this monstrous threat:
>
>1. **The Honorable Fisherman:** Seeking revenge for the destruction of his friend’s ship, this fisherman offers nothing but the thrill of the hunt and a ship to carry you to the kraken’s lair. There is no gold reward—only the promise of excitement and the satisfaction of avenging the lost.
  >  
>2. **The Wealthy Collector:** A collector of rare sea-beast artifacts desires the beak of a baby kraken to add to his collection. He offers a reward of 1000 gold pieces for its retrieval but cannot provide a ship or means to locate the beast.
>
The kraken’s exact location remains unknown, but clues to its whereabouts and habits can be found among the seaside towns and island settlements of [[The Distant Sea]]. Those with courage and skill, ready to face the terror of the deep, should inquire within. The hunt awaits.
- Secondary Quest Hook alternative
> [!NOTE] Quest Hook - Conversation Variant
> "You hear about that baby kraken out in [[The Distant Sea]]?" one grizzled adventurer says, leaning over his mug of ale. His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper, drawing the attention of the others at the table. "A fisherman down by the docks is looking to avenge his friend, whose ship got torn apart by the thing. He’s got a boat and a fire in his belly but no clue where to find the beast. No gold in it, just the thrill of the chase."
>
Another adventurer, a sharp-eyed rogue, chimes in, "Yeah, but if you’re after coin, there’s this rich guy—some collector with a thing for sea-beasts. He’s offering a thousand gold for the kraken’s beak, though he’s not helping with the search. Just imagine, a thousand gold in your pocket if you can track it down and bring back the proof!"
>
The table falls quiet for a moment, the weight of the challenge settling in. "The thing is," the grizzled one continues, "nobody knows exactly where it is, but they say it hunts near islands, and the seas start to smell like sulfur when it’s close. Sounds like we’d have to do some digging around the local towns, maybe [[The Port of Last Call]] or [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]], to pick up its trail. But hell, wouldn’t that be a story to tell?"

- **Quest Description and Information:**
	- *Clues available for the hunt:*
		- It is important that for this Quest, players need to find clues about how to hunt a baby kraken in order to succeed. Else they run the risk of sailing unguided into the seas. 
		- The following is a list of potential clues that the party could get to either help them locate the baby kraken or bait it to attack them.
			1. A Kraken's favorite food is rotting whale blubber. A kraken is sure to hunt with vigor if it can smell it. 
			2. A Kraken can detect scent in the water for a range of 10 miles, giving it a highly precise way of hunting.
			3. A Kraken loves to hunt near islands but hates coral reefs. 
			4. The seas near a Kraken are said to smell sulphiric and metallic when a Kraken is within half of a mile. This can be hinted at to players by describing the sea changing aroma to 'like rotting eggs' or 'like the scent of an unoiled blade.'
	- *Best Locations to search for information:* 
		- Towns by the sea - rumors and myths surrounding the kraken
			- Search by towns far removed from hunting from the deep parts of the seas would give clues as part of myths or stories rather than as actual, factual clues
			- When giving clues in this sense, reference the clues available for this hunt section above and change one aspect of the clue whenever recounting it within a myth or story. 
			- Remember, these stories are legends, not a treatise on the kraken haha. 
		- Island towns - specific information and well known facts
			- Island towns are in harsher, more desperate environments, exposed to much greater danger compares to sea-side towns. As a result, these towns know much more concrete information regarding sea creatures, monsters, and in this case, Kraken.
			- The following towns are a great starting place to use for this Quest:
				- [[The Port of Last Call]] - Town far to the North and West in [[The Distant Sea]], last point of civilization before reaching the confluence of the Northern and Western walls of mist, apart of [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]. 
				- [[The Town of Frost-Haven]] - Town on multiple, rocky, perilously-tall islands slightly south of [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]]. 
				- [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]] - Town on a large island near the [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]] towards the north of [[The Distant Sea]]

### The Sahuaguin Enemy
#### Details About the Enemy
The Sahuagin Interlopers are cunning and ruthless, employing a variety of deadly traps to protect their hideout and eliminate any intruders. Their tactics reflect their underwater origins, but they've adapted remarkably well to the labyrinthine environment of the Salvage Yards. They are spies in the town, gathering information about raider targets, potential threats, and groups hot on their trail. 
#### Creatures to Use
**The Sahuaguin Interloper Party:**
- 1x blade master (use saltmarsh)
- 1x priestess (use saltmarsh)
- 5x Sahuaguin brutes (use monster manual)

The blade master leads the charge into combat, the brutes work the traps around combat, and the priestess casts spells and heals from afar. Make sure they only kite and dodge attacks until they are in a good position, in area they have fortified and know well. 
#### Traps and Tactics
**Tactics:** The Sahuagin Interlopers are well-coordinated, using the chaotic environment of the Salvage Yards to their advantage. They rely on hit-and-run tactics, using their traps to weaken and disorient intruders before moving in for the kill. The Blade Master, a seasoned warrior, leads the charge, directing the brutes in strategic strikes. Meanwhile, the Priestess uses her dark magic to curse and confuse their enemies from afar. 

**Hiding Spots are Key:** The Sahuagin make use of the many hiding spots within the yards, attacking from unexpected angles and retreating into the shadows when faced with strong resistance. They communicate using guttural clicks and whistles, almost inaudible to human ears, ensuring that they can coordinate their attacks without revealing their positions.

**Kiting and Group Attack:** They will attack a group, but will seek to lure them away and into an area that they trapped and prepared before hand to defend. They know that an attack is likely, so this makes sense. 

**Traps:**
1. **Nets and Tripwires**: The Sahuagin have strategically placed nearly invisible nets woven from seaweed and sturdy fibers across narrow pathways. These nets are rigged to tripwires, which, when triggered, cause the net to spring up and entangle unsuspecting adventurers. The nets are coated in a slick, oily substance that makes escape difficult and leaves those trapped vulnerable to attacks.    
2. **Oil Flasks and Fire Traps**: Hidden among the debris are flasks of oil carefully placed to spill when disturbed. Tripwires are attached to these flasks, and when triggered, the oil spreads quickly across the ground. The Sahuagin have set up torches and flint traps that can ignite the oil, creating a sudden blaze. They may also use fire arrows or flaming crossbow bolts to ignite the oil remotely, cutting off escape routes or forcing their enemies into more dangerous areas.    
3. **Poisoned Crossbows and Tripwire Triggers**: Crossbows are hidden within piles of wreckage, aimed at choke points and passageways. These crossbows are rigged to tripwires, and when triggered, they fire bolts laced with paralytic poison. The poison is fast-acting, designed to slow down or incapacitate intruders, making them easy prey for the Sahuagin.    
4. **Fall Traps**: The Sahuagin have set up false floors and weak planks across key areas of the Salvage Yards. These areas are rigged to collapse under weight, dropping intruders into pits filled with jagged metal, splintered wood, or even waiting Sahuagin brutes. The traps are often disguised with a thin layer of debris, making them difficult to spot until it's too late.    
5. **Swinging Wreckage**: Using their strength and knowledge of the yards, the Sahuagin have rigged massive chunks of wreckage—like old ship masts or anchors—on ropes and pulleys. These are set to swing down from above when a tripwire is triggered, crushing anything in their path. The Sahuagin may also release these traps manually from hidden vantage points, timing their attacks to cause maximum damage.
#### Sahuaguin Hideout
**Location**: The Sahuagin hideout is cleverly concealed within the deepest, most treacherous part of the Salvage Yards, known as the "Wrecked Maw." This area is a tangled mess of ship hulls, rusted chains, and broken masts, creating a natural maze of debris. The entrance to the hideout is hidden beneath a large, barnacle-encrusted anchor that appears to be just another piece of forgotten wreckage.
**Entrance**: To access the hideout, the Sahuagin lift the anchor—using a pulley system they've rigged—and slip through a narrow opening beneath it. The entrance leads into a submerged tunnel that extends into the heart of their lair. This tunnel is filled with seawater, providing the Sahuagin with a strategic advantage as they can move through it quickly while most intruders will struggle to navigate or even breathe in the confined space.
**Main Chamber**: The main chamber of the hideout is an open area within the belly of an ancient shipwreck. The walls are lined with stolen treasures and trinkets, trophies of the Sahuagin’s past raids. A large pool of seawater dominates the center, providing the Sahuagin with a means of escape if needed. The Blade Master’s quarters are located here, along with a small shrine to their dark god, where the Priestess performs her rituals.
**Ambush Points**: Around the main chamber, the Sahuagin have set up several ambush points, including elevated perches made from stacked crates and debris, where brutes can rain down attacks from above. These perches also serve as lookouts, giving the Sahuagin an early warning system against intruders.
**Escape Routes**: The hideout features multiple escape routes, including narrow tunnels leading out to various points in the Salvage Yards. These tunnels are well hidden and can be collapsed in an emergency, sealing off the Sahuagin's retreat and trapping any pursuers.
**Defensive Measures**: The entrance to the hideout is heavily guarded by traps and sentries. The Sahuagin have also trained several of the Salvage Yard’s native creatures—such as the Rustmonger Crabs and Scuttleweavers—to patrol the area, adding another layer of defense against intruders.

This hideout serves as a well-fortified base for the Sahuagin, allowing them to spy on the town while remaining hidden and protected by the chaos of the Salvage Yards.
#### Double Dealing
The Sahuaguin do not work alone. For information and capturing additional slaves, the Sahuaguin provide [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] with gold and precious goods that they have stole from town. They have short meetings with [[Tennyson Heralds]] while Temple Guards stand watch and lookout over the Salvage Yards. If the guards are asked about the nature of the meeting, or what they are doing in the yards, they simply say they were looking to go for a nice stroll. 

This could also be a good place to introduce [[Ignel Valis]], a target of [[Wake Tiraus]]. He could show up to explore the wreckage to meet with the Sahuaguin or as a part of [[Tennyson Heralds]] group since he works with them, as a correspondent from [[Fedorov's Legion]]. 

**Capturing Children:** Since the group works with [[Tennyson Heralds]], they target vulnerable children to capture in town, specifically ones of parents that seem a little too eager to explore [[The High Forests]]. These children are taken to the Temple Glade in [[Gullhook]] and then given, as per an agreement with [[Fedorov's Legion]], to [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] to be brainwashed and transported to [[The South-East Coast]] via [[The Blood-Stone Pass]].
