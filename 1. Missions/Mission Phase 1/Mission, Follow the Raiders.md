Campaign: [[Mist Sessions]]
Prior: [[Mission, Defend Saddle-Port, Part 2]]
# General Overview
The party attempted to defend [[Saddle-Port]] and failed. 3 Miners and [[Vivian Lovejoy]] were captured, [[Deion Deus]] made a devilish deal with [[Yugo Stolid]], and the group narrowly escaped death. The group organized repair efforts in [[Saddle-Port]], namely the assignment of young wood workers to teaching the fishermen woodcraft (badly made ships are now in progress), and then left to travel up the coast to [[Smears-burrow]] and eventually [[Gullhook]]. [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] recovered map fragments from the library fire and a local fishermen shed light on 5 sea caves dotting the coast between [[Smears-burrow]] and [[Saddle-Port]]. The group planned to head to [[Smears-burrow]] and then check out the sea cave. They were provided a small raft by the council of [[Smears-burrow]] and are beginning to sail towards the caves.
# Mission Objectives:
This need to open up the players to avenues of revenge, exploration, and mystery. It should lead towards [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and uncovering more about the raiders. *This is a top priority.*
1. **Discover** more about where the raiders organize, hide, raid from, and store resources
2. **Mystery** about the island should become more relevant, introduce monuments from [[The Many]]. Introduce language of many as cypher you created. 
3. **Puzzle.** Need something brain-working. Relate to dungeon, unlocking a chest, deciphering a map, etc. Make players think for a while. 
4. **Dungeons**. There needs to be a dungeon, relate it to [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] and an old place relevant to [[The Many]] (don't make it too apparent). 
5. **Chase**. A high stakes chase. Requires choosing a path, forced marching, levying short rests, and either following a group or escaping from being followed by an enemy. 
# Phase 1: Caves and Smears-burrow
Currently the party is starting on a raft, leaving [[Smears-burrow]], sailing into the tail end of a thunderstorm.
### Sea Caves:
There are 5 sea caves, described as following. They are listed as if you were moving from [[Saddle-Port]] to [[Smears-burrow]] along the coast.
1. **Rock Pillar Cave**: 5 mi from [[Saddle-Port]]. Has a tall rock pillar out in the sea near it to denote a secret entrance. Cave not visible from sea.
2. **Low Tide Cave**: 15 mi from [[Saddle-Port]]. Only accessible at low tide. High tide submerges the cave. 
3. **High Tide Cave**: 25 mi from [[Saddle-Port]].  At high tide, a ship can sail directly into the cave. 
4. **Underwater Cave**: 30 mi from [[Saddle-Port]]. Cave that is fully submerged underwater. Requires swimming to access it. 
5. **Lover's Cave**: 45 mi from [[Saddle-Port]]. Normal cave near sharp sea rocks. Near lover's point, close to [[Smears-burrow]]. 
### What is the deal with the caves?
Used by [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] for staging raids and storing supplies. These caves contain special clues and hints about where the followers congregate and store goods/prisoners.
1. **Rock Pillar Cave**: Map of other parts of highlands that group is missing. Part of clue to follower's hideout. Recent activity at this part.
2. **Low Tide Cave**: Training area with leftover weapons. Part of clue to follower's hideout. 
3. **High Tide Cave**: A guide on subduing prisoners and protocol. Part of clue to follower's hideout. Recent activity at this part. 
4. **Underwater Cave**: Alchemists station with recipe book for potions (paralyzing and water breathing). 
5. **Lover's Cave**: Already gone through by [[Slug Stoll]]. 
### What are the Clues?
They are a series of directions, relative to landmarks. They lead to an ancient underground complex used by [[The Many]]. They use this complex because the operation was headed by [[Silvan Gile]] who explored this. The complex is an early on living complex for [[The Many]]. It doesn't have a major purpose other than for living. 

**The Clues:**
1. Distant Overlook **good**
2. Statue of [[The Wildmother]] **neutral**
3. Statue of [[The Knowing Mentor]] **neutral**
4. Statue of [[The Matron of Ravens]] **neutral**
5. Statue of [[The Spider Queen]] **evil**
6. Statue of [[The Whispered One]] **evil**
7. The revitalizing springs **good**
8. The wishing pond **neutral**
9. The kelp bay **neutral**

2. The green women (2)
3. The wishing pond (8)
4. The father of undeath (6)
5. The grey robes (3)
6. The pale woman (4)
7. The revitalizing spring (7)

##### How is this used?
1. Each place has a rune of the language I created on it and they need all 9 for a password
2. The order matters, the second password relates to the order in which the gods/places were visited. Good/Neutral/Evil
