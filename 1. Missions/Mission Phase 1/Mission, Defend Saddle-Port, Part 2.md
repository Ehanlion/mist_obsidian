> Note: I am going to try a new approach to writing a Mission. This time, instead of fully writing everything out, I am going to leave a lot of openings for improv and instead focus on highlighting general structure, some names of important things, and some key events I want to happen. 

# Recap from Last Time
In [[Mission, Defend Saddle-Port, Part 1]], the party essentially rallied the townsfolk in an effort to ready the town of [[Saddle-Port]] for a defense against raiders from [[Karak-Ulgurath]] (don't know this creature is behind it) and against [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. The session ended with combat started, and [[Wake]] delivering an epic strike with the aid of the spell Sky-strike and delivering three lumberjacks into combat as well. [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] was atop the library, perched up there with the giant mounted ballista, and used feather fall to levitate the lumberjacks down. [[Deion Deus]] and [[Slug Stoll]] were inside the Drunken Wyvern tavern with Herbert/Alice and [[Vivian Lovejoy]] ready to defend against intruders. 

# Setting Up Combat + Raid Enemy Types
Refer to the raid examples within [[Karak-Ulgurath Town Raid Example]] for guiding the raid. 

![[Karak-Ulgurath Town Raid Example]]

#### A Note on Destruction
Other towns were subject to *unsuspecting* night raids. This time the raid was predicted, and so a fight is ensuing. 

Destroying [[Saddle-Port]] is a **goal** of this mission. Target the *Drunken Wyvern* tavern, the *Cozy Book Nook (library)*, *Yugo's store*, *the bull pens*, and all *fishing boats*. One or two shots from siege crabs. 

# Raid Focus
Focus all efforts upon capturing [[Vivian Lovejoy]] and the three miners that happened to be staying in the town. Disregard all player characters and other character and focus entirely on capturing these key targets. 

__ __
# Conducting Combat
Players will control the NPCs of the town, except for very strong NPCs and key *target* NPCs (like [[Vivian Lovejoy]], the miners can be controlled it's fine). 
#### Grouping NPCs
Group **NPC turns** directly *after* the player's turn that control them. Group **enemies** by type and from each group. Each group has key enemies like *priestesses* and *barons* as well as brutes. Group the brutes, and leave the others. **End up with 3 entities in combat per enemy group**.
### Environment
The raid takes place at night, during a thunderstorm. Use **heavy wind**, **lightning strikes**, and **heavy rain** to add *danger*, and importantly, *obscure vision*. 

1. **Lightning:** Deals 1d12 lightning damage to 3 targets. Thunder that follows makes talking to anyone 15 ft away or more impossible.
2. **Heavy Wind:** Makes moving in the direction of the wind count as difficult terrain and moving away from the wind count as double speed. Other directions not impacted.
3. **Heavy Rain Sheets:** [[heavily obscured]] condition used, all attacks made at disadvantage. Cannot see beyond 5 ft.  

## External Factors:
Remember that the creatures, since they are part of [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], have [[Mutated Barnacle Growths]] on them.
