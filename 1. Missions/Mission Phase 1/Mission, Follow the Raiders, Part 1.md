Campaign: [[Mist Sessions]]
Prior: [[Mission, Defend Saddle-Port, Part 2]]
# General Overview
The party attempted to defend [[Saddle-Port]] and failed. 3 Miners and [[Vivian Lovejoy]] were captured, [[Deion Deus]] made a devilish deal with [[Yugo Stolid]], and the group narrowly escaped death. The group organized repair efforts in [[Saddle-Port]], namely the assignment of young wood workers to teaching the fishermen woodcraft (badly made ships are now in progress), and then left to travel up the coast to [[Smears-burrow]] and eventually [[Gullhook]]. [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] recovered map fragments from the library fire and a local fishermen shed light on 5 sea caves dotting the coast between [[Smears-burrow]] and [[Saddle-Port]]. The group planned to head to [[Smears-burrow]] and then check out the sea cave. They were provided a small raft by the council of [[Smears-burrow]] and are beginning to sail towards the caves.
# Mission Objectives:
This need to open up the players to avenues of revenge, exploration, and mystery. It should lead towards [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and uncovering more about the raiders. *This is a top priority.*
1. **Discover** more about where the raiders organize, hide, raid from, and store resources
2. **Mystery** about the island should become more relevant, introduce monuments from [[The Many]]. Introduce language of many as cypher you created. 
3. **Puzzle.** Need something brain-working. Relate to dungeon, unlocking a chest, deciphering a map, etc. Make players think for a while. 
4. **Dungeons**. There needs to be a dungeon, relate it to [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] and an old place relevant to [[The Many]] (don't make it too apparent). 
5. **Chase**. A high stakes chase. Requires choosing a path, forced marching, levying short rests, and either following a group or escaping from being followed by an enemy. 
# Phase 1: Caves and Smears-burrow
Currently the party is starting on a raft, leaving [[Smears-burrow]], sailing into the tail end of a thunderstorm.
### Sea Caves:
There are 5 sea caves, described as following. They are listed as if you were moving from [[Saddle-Port]] to [[Smears-burrow]] along the coast.
1. **Rock Pillar Cave**: 5 mi from [[Saddle-Port]]. Has a tall rock pillar out in the sea near it to denote a secret entrance. Cave not visible from sea.
2. **Low Tide Cave**: 15 mi from [[Saddle-Port]]. Only accessible at low tide. High tide submerges the cave. 
3. **High Tide Cave**: 25 mi from [[Saddle-Port]].  At high tide, a ship can sail directly into the cave. 
4. **Underwater Cave**: 30 mi from [[Saddle-Port]]. Cave that is fully submerged underwater. Requires swimming to access it. 
5. **Lover's Cave**: 45 mi from [[Saddle-Port]]. Normal cave near sharp sea rocks. Near lover's point, close to [[Smears-burrow]]. 
### What is in the Sea Caves?
Used by [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] for staging raids and storing supplies. These caves contain special clues and hints about where the followers congregate and store goods/prisoners.
1. **Rock Pillar Cave**: Map of other parts of highlands that group is missing. Part of clue to follower's hideout. Recent activity at this part.
2. **Low Tide Cave**: Training area with leftover weapons. Part of clue to follower's hideout. 
3. **High Tide Cave**: A guide on subduing prisoners and protocol. Part of clue to follower's hideout. Recent activity at this part. 
4. **Underwater Cave**: Alchemists station with recipe book for potions (paralyzing and water breathing). 
5. **Lover's Cave**: Already gone through by [[Slug Stoll]]. 
### What are the Clues?
They are a series of directions, relative to landmarks. They lead to an ancient underground complex used by [[The Many]]. They use this complex because the operation was headed by [[Silvan Gile]] who explored this. The complex is an early on living complex for [[The Many]]. It doesn't have a major purpose other than for living but it should include cool references. 
# The Clues I made:
The clues are a series of vague descriptions about places within the High Forest. There are 4 locations and 5 statues of gods, these are those locations/gods:
1. The Distant Overlook
2. The Revitalizing Spring 
3. The Wishing Pond
4. The Bay of Kelp
5. [[The Wildmother]]
6. [[The Whispered One]]
7. [[The Matron of Ravens]]
8. [[The Spider Queen]]
9. [[The Knowing Mentor]]

**The opening blurb to the riddle is as follows:**
Travel the hidden journey, 
prayers to lost divinities,
of hidden sigil and rights or wrongs,
keyed entry of two is found. 

Then this is followed by the Clues below, in order, from top to bottom. 

| Deity/Location              | Clue                            | Alignment |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| [[The Distant Overlook]]    | The point of whale spotting     | Good      |
| [[The Wildmother]]          | The green woman                 | Neutral   |
| [[The Wishing Pond]]        | The wishing pond                | Neutral   |
| [[The Whispered One]]       | The father of death             | Evil      |
| [[The Knowing Mentor]]      | The gray-robed woman            | Neutral   |
| [[The Matron of Ravens]]    | The pale woman                  | Neutral   |
| [[The Revitalizing Spring]] | The revitalizing spring         | Good      |
| [[The Spider Queen]]        | The opulent, alluring woman     | Evil      |
| [[The Bay of Kelp]]         | The churning, green ocean waves | Neutral   |

### What to look for and where they lead:
These clues **do not have to be explored in order**.
However, the order listed on the riddle **does matter**.
The players **must** find all 9 locations, discover the runes on each, and assign each location the correct alignment. 
##### Finding the Runes:
The party will find runes at each clue location. These runes are in *deep speech*, the ancient language of [[The Many]]. The party does not need to understand what the runes say. *The runes are one of the two passcodes to entering the complex.* 
##### Assigning the Alignments:
The party will also need to understand the alignment of each location. This is more obscure. The alignment of the deities is straight forwards but the alignment of the locations is more up-in-the-air. *The alignments are the second of two passcodes to enter the complex.*
