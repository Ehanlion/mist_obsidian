# Important Docs for this Session
1. [[Gullhook]] - for town stuff
2. [[The High Forests]] - for forest stuff
3. [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] - for Sahuaguin encounter stuff 
# START HERE:
The party starts in the sea cave with the spire out front, 5 miles from [[Saddle-Port]]. They are 45 miles from [[Smears-burrow]], or about 1 long day in the rough weather. 

I predict that they will go to [[Smears-burrow]] and dick around. Remember that, by lending them the raft, the council asked them to take a delivery up to [[Gullhook]]. The delivery is mostly rarer ice-rocks from cliffs, some rare fish, and gold for trade. 

They will take either the boat or a cart up. Probably sink the boat right as they get into [[Smears-burrow]] to encourage using a cart. I don't want to GM a boat and better to sea coast byway. 
# SENSORY:
- **Rain**: make sure to highlight the feelings of the thunderstorm. Lessen these feelers as the storm abates or as the group moves out of it.
- **Wind**: Gullhook is windy, make sure to describe how the cool breeze ripples through hair and clothes.
- **Town-noise**: Gullhook is VERY busy, it should feel abundant and energetic at every turn.
	- Describe small events as players walk through 
	- Make small noises as players enter shops etc.
	- Use ambient town music to create a sense of chaos and energy
- **Forest Ambience**: Really important, make each area of forest different
	- Untamed Verdant - explosion of color, scent, and texture 
	- Serenity Groves - quiet, easing, relaxing, Feels lazy and laid back
	- Glades of Fate - spooky but good spooky, feels old and regal in a way
	- Charmed Royalties - eeriest, huge webs impede movement, skittering from spiders in distance
	- Widow-Maker's Stands - Deathly quiet, direct foil to Untamed Verdant in every possible way
- **Sahuaguin**: Messy, smells like the sea and rotting fish, crude and barbaric. Guttural throat noises, war cries, and fear tactics in battle

# The Clues I made:
**The opening blurb to the riddle is as follows:**
Travel the hidden journey, 
prayers to lost divinities,
of hidden sigil and rights or wrongs,
keyed entry of two is found. 

| Deity/Location              | Clue                            | Alignment |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| [[The Distant Overlook]]    | The point of whale spotting     | Good      |
| [[The Wildmother]]          | The green woman                 | Neutral   |
| [[The Wishing Pond]]        | The wishing pond                | Neutral   |
| [[The Whispered One]]       | The father of death             | Evil      |
| [[The Knowing Mentor]]      | The gray-robed woman            | Neutral   |
| [[The Matron of Ravens]]    | The pale woman                  | Neutral   |
| [[The Revitalizing Spring]] | The revitalizing spring         | Good      |
| [[The Spider Queen]]        | The opulent, alluring woman     | Evil      |
| [[The Bay of Kelp]]         | The churning, green ocean waves | Neutral   |

## What to look for and where they lead:
These clues **do not have to be explored in order**.
However, the order listed on the riddle **does matter**.
The players **must** find all 9 locations, discover the runes on each, and assign each location the correct alignment. 
### Finding the Runes:
The party will find runes at each clue location. These runes are in *deep speech*, the ancient language of [[The Many]]. The party does not need to understand what the runes say. *The runes are one of the two passcodes to entering the complex.* 

Passcode: V A L E N T I N O (spelled in 16 character cypher I created). 
### Assigning the Alignments:
The party will also need to understand the alignment of each location. This is more obscure. The alignment of the deities is straight forwards but the alignment of the locations is more up-in-the-air. *The alignments are the second of two passcodes to enter the complex.* 

| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     | x   |     |     |     | x   |     |
|     | x   | x   |     | x   | x   |     |     | x   |
| x   |     |     |     |     |     | x   |     |     |

At the bottom of input is Gold Dragon (lawful good) and the top has a Black Dragon (Chaotic Evil). The black dragon is actually [[Agnedelo the Plague-Bringer]], friend of [[Valentino]]. The gold dragon is [[Kragclaw, The Golden Beast]], a normal gold dragon of ancient lore. They won't know this but it is fun to allude to. 
# Understanding regions in [[The High Forests]]
![[The High Forests]]
# NEXT STEPS: Post-Start and Smears-burrow
Realistically, I expect the players to venture to [[Gullhook]] first. A lot of the elements of the riddle are only understandable if they start to learn more about the pantheon. This requires them to speak to locals and [[Gullhook]] is close to [[The High Forests]].
### Key Things to understand
1. The **Runes** are on each statue and hidden around each location in the riddle. They are easy to find.
2. Make the connection between whale watching and the distant overlook well known, that first clue should be easy and lead the party towards what they have to find. 
3. The [[Gullhook]] NPCs refer to the "deities in the woods," "ancient statues," and strange phenomenon if asked. Religious leaders would know rumors of powerful statues but not of their locations.
4. Local kooks in taverns, or by the cliffs would have tall tales about the other locations in the forests. 
5. Be cryptic - Remember: even the locals have varying tales about the forests, what goes on, what lives there, what the shrines are, and where things are located.
6. **Important:** The locals do know that the Sahuaguin attacks, many were taken, that the Sahuaguin attacked from forest and sea, and that there are Sahuaguin in the forests still. 

Other than that, roleplay heavy in [[Gullhook]] and pivot to using [[The High Forests]] document to run that part of the mission. 
# Running [[Gullhook]]
Okay Gullhook is pretty expansive so ad-lib with stuff there and make it canon later. Just do your best to keep things flowing and split between players whenever possible. 

**Important things to stick to:**
- Raiders were going to attack town, town defenders, huge battle, many dead on both sides, wide spread destruction on side facing [[The High Forests]] and side facing the cliffs / [[The Distant Sea]]. 
- Miners/stone-workers are missing
- Librarians from library are missing
- Many vacancies for jobs/skilled labor, many lost during fights
- General wariness of outsiders, guards at gates check for barnacles growths upon entry
- [[Gullhook]] had between 1-2 thousand residents and they lost around a hundred or so. 

**Cool hooks or ideas to seed in town:**
- Glimpses of Sahuaguin to high passive perception, tracking leads back to salvage yard. Some Sahuaguin are spying on the town. 
- Igor and Dmitri were here, Dmitri went off to visit Livy's Livestock. Igor is in town still. Hear about this from a random tavern, maybe Chugga's or the brothel, love makes its way. 
	- This would be for Wake specifically, if they ask around have people refer them to bars or brothel or something idk
- Monsters hunters needed in the Guildhall, group can choose to abandon their quest and go monster hunting instead.
	- Crews are here from island towns of:
		- [[The Port of Last Call]] - further east than other island towns
		- [[The Town of Frost-Haven]] - icy, cold town surrounded with icebergs far north
		- [[Warden-Hunter's Hideout]] - right near [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]]
- Deion can meet some old friends from [[Gandoras City]] at the Trading Post, since this is where the caravans pass through. Caravans have been having a rough time, the one currently in town is the last one since [[Gandoras City]] and the Trade Guild are shutting them down due to violence. 
- Rock-tenders need help levitating a ship, good chance for Kelswin to learn magic but not magic? 
- The Other Way and [[Arnov Vasilov]] can help with the Mind Rock and some info about that. He can tell tales about the South east coast? Maybe allude to [[Ignel Valis]] as Sylvan Gile here? Just say like, oh powerful magic, knew a wizard from the coast who did that, name was Sylvan, Sylvan Gile or something.
- People going missing in town, specifically those who have already lost loved ones. Connected to [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[The Followers of Alsolace]] who are abducting people and sending them to [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]]. This connect to [[Dmitri Mironov]], who is gone from [[Gullhook]] because he is taking some abductees to [[Livy's Livestock (Slave House)]] and [[Igor Larionov]] who is helping but is hiding out in [[Gullhook]]. 
	- [[Igor Larionov]] and [[Dmitri Mironov]] are helping because the slaves get shipped back to [[Fedorov's Legion]] or to [[The Sunken Caverns]] for [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]], as per [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] orders.
