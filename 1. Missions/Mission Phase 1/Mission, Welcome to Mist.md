Welcome to Mist adventurers. I hope you enjoy the many, many adventures that are yet to come. 
# An Intro to Mist
>Some live amidst the swaying grass of the north-west highlands. Some make their homes in the deep forests of the north-east. Some brave the treacherous paths of the south-east mountains. Some lead lives of mischief and bravery along the south-east coast. Some brave souls make their stands in the hot deserts of the south-west. But all who live here, make their lives on Mist. 

> Today, our story begins rather lazily in the placid town of [[Saddle-Port]]. Smoke wafts up some chimneys in town. You can hear to playful shouts of village children. In the background, fishermen haul up fish from their vessels. 

# First Beginnings
The adventure begins in [[The North-West Highlands]], in the village of [[Saddle-Port]]. This is [[Kelswin Lovejoy]]'s home village.

These are the two main hooks for adventure. Either one of them will end up with Vivian getting taken and the group having to choose to follow or to give up.

___
## 1. Town's Guard in the Tavern:
Walking through town you hear murmurings of people being taken or having gone missing from towns up the coast from [[Saddle-Port]]. 

#### The Tavern:
A man by the name of [[Jordan Leabrook]] is the town's guard. He knows a little about people going missing up the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]]. He is motivated to learn more about the missing people because none have gone missing from [[Saddle-Port]] yet, and since he has kids, he wants to make sure that they are not in danger. 

#### Jordan's Suggestions:
Jordan recommends that the group stages a stake-out for the next week in order to wait to see if anything pops up. If the group does not like that, they can also choose to venture up to the next town called [[Smears-burrow]] and ask about the vanishings there. 

##### Heading up to Smears-burrow:
[[Smears-burrow]] is a 3 day trip north along the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]]. 

If they do travel to [[Smears-burrow]] it is important to note some of the things that they can find there that are out of the ordinary:
1. There are dark blue scuff marks on one of the jetties in [[Smears-burrow]] that is NOT reserved for visitors. The blue scuff marks could only have been made by [[Reggie Brown]]'s ship since it is a dark blue. The party wouldn't know that it is his ship, and would only know if something is out of order if they ask.
2. [[Reggie Brown]] is missing, along-side his ship. They went missing BEFORE there was a raid on the village. [[Reggie Brown]] was killed while exploring a sea cave related to [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. His boat was stolen by the raiders and was used to raid [[Smears-burrow]]s, although no one knows that yet. 

##### Conducting a Stake-Out:
Staging the stake-out will bear results after 3 days. At that point a raid will occur on the town. The raiders want to take [[Vivian Lovejoy]] because she is a librarian and that is the only person they need from the town. 

They group cannot win -- the raiding part is large and powerful. The good new is that they are trying to take [[Vivian Lovejoy]], cause damage, and run. The group can play defensive and try to protect the town or they can try to kill the aggressors.

___
## 2. Poor Merchant in the Tavern:
A local fishermen by the name of [[Barney Carper]] enters the Drunken Wyvern tavern in a state of soggy dismay.

#### The Poor Merchant:
A captain of a merchant vessel by the name of [[Barney Carper]] is bemoaning the loss of his ship. It sank not far off the shore of [[Saddle-Port]], at a point off the coast, about a days journey up the coast. He need people to retrieve the lock box and he can't do it; the ship is sunk in over 100 feet of water.

#### The Stan-ta Ray:
The ship is a small merchant vessel. It has the strong box located in the helm. It is locked with a DC 20 Slight of Hand check needed to open it. The bigger issue is that the ship is in 100 feet of water, making getting down to it a difficult task. 

> Easter Egg, but the ship is called 'The Stan-ta Ray,' a joke after Gravity Fall's 'Stan-of-War.'

The ship sunk directly out to sea from a small sea cave. This sea cave is empty, but upon examination people can see that it is clearly being used. The sea cave is being used by a group of raiders, as detailed in [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. When the group is exploring the ship, they will find the cave abandoned but they can explore it.
#### A Mysterious Sea Cave:
They will find multiple cages, multiple tridents, and lots of rope. They will also find a the mauled corpse of a miner. Examining it closer will reveal numerous wounds, indicating he died while struggling. He has a pick-axe on him with the initials R.B. He is missing from the town of [[Smears-burrow]]. 

**Things to find:**
1. Tridents
2. 10 Sleeping cots
3. Multiple, Large Cages
4. A pile of weighted nets. 
5. Around 10 Spools of Rope alongside grappling hooks and crossbow launchers for the grapplers. 
6. A dead corpse belonging to [[Reggie Brown]], initials R.B. He has a fishing rod with him, a bright yellow jacket he was known to wears, and nothing else. A DC 12 medicine check reveals he died in a struggle. 
7. A locked crate: DC 15 Slight of Hand to pick, reveals a strange, wet herb and multiple glowing vials. It is Gillyweed and paralysis potions. They are used to allow captured creatures to breath underwater and the paralysis potion is used to paralyze the captured creatures while they are transported. 

A DC 10 investigation check reveals that the cave was inhabited by many creatures of the sea. A DC 15 investigation check reveals the number of creatures, well over 30. 
#### Reward:
The captain will offer anyone who returns his lock box half of what it contains -- a total sum of 500 gold of gems and jewels.

# Post Hooks:
Realistically, things get a little wishy-washy here. Both hooks are setup to have the party eventually get back to [[Saddle-Port]]. That would allow for a raid by members of [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]]. They would search for Librarians and stone masons, as described in [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. This means the raiders would target [[Vivian Lovejoy]] and maybe [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] (since they are both librarian-related).

The end-all, be all, is that there should be a combat where the party comes face to face with a force of [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] and the party is outmatched by this force.
