___
## 1. Town's Guard in the Tavern:
Walking through town you hear murmurings of people being taken or having gone missing from towns up the coast from [[Saddle-Port]]. 

#### The Tavern:
A man by the name of [[Jordan Leabrook]] is the town's guard. He knows a little about people going missing up the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]]. He is motivated to learn more about the missing people because none have gone missing from [[Saddle-Port]] yet, and since he has kids, he wants to make sure that they are not in danger. 
#### Jordan's Suggestions:
Joran mentions that he heard about the vanishing as he was leaving [[Smears-burrow]]. He just got back to [[Saddle-Port]]. 

He will offer to accompany the group to [[Smears-burrow]] to help them look around there for more clues as to what exactly is going on.
#### Heading up to Smears-burrow:
[[Smears-burrow]] is 40 miles north and west along the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]] from [[Saddle-Port]].
#### Learning about the raids:
It is crucial that the party learns about the raid that occurred at [[Smears-burrow]]. [[Smears-burrow]] was raided earlier in the week and [[Gullhook]], the next town up and along [[The North-West Highlands]]'s coast, was raided a week before [[Smears-burrow]]. The raids occurred on week's start (Monday).

Three people were taken from [[Smears-burrow]]:
1. Mary-Anne Birch (elf), the librarian for the Old Birch Library. 
2. Fogram Heavygaze (goliath), a prolific miner 
3. Gurdath Fallonswallow (firbolg), a well liked and boisterous miner

Another person went missing **before** the raid occurred:
1. [[Reggie Brown]] (human): a fisherman is missing as well as his **blue** boat.
#### Out of the ordinary things:
1. There are dark blue scuff marks on one of the jetties in [[Smears-burrow]] that is NOT reserved for visitors. The blue scuff marks could only have been made by [[Reggie Brown]]'s ship since it is a dark blue. The party wouldn't know that it is his ship, and would only know if something is out of order if they ask.
2. [[Reggie Brown]] is missing, along-side his ship. They went missing BEFORE there was a raid on the village. [[Reggie Brown]] was killed while exploring a sea cave related to [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. His boat was stolen by the raiders and was used to raid [[Smears-burrow]]s, although no one knows that yet. 
3. There are flipper marks near the library and the masonry building in [[Smears-burrow]]. The flipper marks are abnormally large. There are also signs of a struggle. 
4. Some people living near the library and masonry buildings remember hearing the sounds of gargling water and splashing coming from nearby. These sounds were head in the 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. hours of the morning. 

#### Determining the next raid:
1. This is not the first place to have these disappearances. Another raid took place in [[Gullhook]], the next town up the coast, a week before the raid on [[Smears-burrow]]. Another took place a week prior to that at [[Anchorpoint Fisheries]], the town up the coast from [[Gullhook]]. 
2. If the party uncovers this they may ask what days these raids occurred on. They occurred on week's start (Monday). The party arrives in [[Smears-burrow]] on the morning of 5th's day (Friday) so they may conclude that another raid would happen at [[Saddle-Port]] on the coming week's start (Monday).
#### Stakeout:
If the party comes to the correct conclusion that something raided the village, [[Jordan Leabrook]] suggests conducting a stakeout back in [[Saddle-Port]] to see if they can keep watch for the same thing that might happen there. 

If the party chooses to do this, they will see results rather quickly. A raid will occur on the village, targeting [[Vivian Lovejoy]]. Refer to [[The Vanishings in the North-West]] to create the raid. It should be impossible for the party to stop the raid.

## 2. Poor Merchant in the Tavern:
A local fishermen by the name of [[Barney Carper]] enters the Drunken Wyvern tavern in a state of soggy dismay.
#### The Poor Merchant:
A captain of a merchant vessel by the name of [[Barney Carper]] is bemoaning the loss of his ship. It sank not far off the shore of [[Saddle-Port]]. He was doing night fishing and felt a grating and jarring against the hull, suddenly the boat was sinking and Barney could not stop it.

[[Barney Carper]]'s boat is named 'The Stan-ta Ray' since his dead best friend, Stand, loved Manta Rays, a common sight in [[The Distant Sea]]. 

#### Getting down to the water:
I heard players talking about diving down into the water. This is suicide. The cliffs near where the Stan-ta Ray sank are 200 feet tall. Regard the rules for [[diving into water]] for this part. However this is no path down, so players might opt for this. Climbing is of course an option but be careful --  a fall from the cliff may end up worse than just jumping. The cliffs are NOT perfectly vertical and slope outwards from their tops to their bottoms. 

Jordan will offer to get scaling materials like a grapnel or two as well as long, lightweight rope that can be used to rappel down the cliff. He will also provide basic climbing gear but this is hard to use for a beginner. 

[[Barney Carper]] escaped because his ship sank in the early hours of the morning in darkness, he then treaded water and was rescued by another ship he was fishing with. They were both from [[Saddle-Port]]. He screamed for help and the other ship grabbed him then left in a hurry for deeper water. 
#### The Stan-ta Ray:
The ship is a 30 foot fishing trawler. The boat has sank in 80 feet of water, 100 feet from the shore. It has an elevated steerage deck with a covering. The lockbox is hidden under a plank on the steerage deck. Passive perception of 12 or above notices two large sharks lazily swimming nearby. 

**Damage to the ship:**
If anyone examines the hull of the ship, they will find large amounts of scraping and shattered wood planks. A good investigation check marks the damages as giant shark bites along side trident and harpoon markings. 

**Raiders in the ship:**
A couple raiders have been left behind to guard over the cave, in case the raiding part has trouble and needs to come back. They are hiding in the ruins of the ship and are using stealth to remain hidden. Unless the party is stealth when swimming down to the ship, the raiders notice them and ambush them. 

There are two [Saghuagin](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sahuagin#content) and they each have one [Hunter Shark](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hunter%20Shark#content).
#### A Mysterious Sea Cave:
The ship sunk directly out to sea from a small sea cave. This sea cave is empty, but upon examination people can see that it is clearly being used. However, [[Barney Carper]] (who's ship this is) did not see the cave because he was fishing at night.

The sea cave is being used by a group of raiders, as detailed in [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. When the group is exploring the ship, they will find the cave abandoned but they can explore it. 

They will find multiple cages, multiple tridents, and lots of rope. They will also find a the mauled corpse of a miner. Examining it closer will reveal numerous wounds, indicating he died while struggling. He has a pick-axe on him with the initials R.B. He is missing from the town of [[Smears-burrow]]. 

**Things to find:**
1. Tridents
2. 10 Sleeping cots
3. Multiple, Large Cages
4. A pile of weighted nets. 
5. Around 10 Spools of Rope alongside grappling hooks and crossbow launchers for the grapplers. 
6. A dead corpse belonging to [[Reggie Brown]], initials R.B. He has a fishing rod with him, a bright yellow jacket he was known to wears, and nothing else. A DC 12 medicine check reveals he died in a struggle. 
7. A locked crate: DC 15 Slight of Hand to pick, reveals a strange, wet herb and multiple glowing vials. It is Gillyweed and paralysis potions. They are used to allow captured creatures to breath underwater and the paralysis potion is used to paralyze the captured creatures while they are transported. 

A DC 10 investigation check reveals that the cave was inhabited by many creatures of the sea. A DC 15 investigation check reveals the number of creatures, well over 30. 
#### The Purpose of the Cave:
The cave housed members of the raiding parties that raided [[Smears-burrow]] and now are looking to raid [[Saddle-Port]]. The raiders are using a ship belonging to [[Reggie Brown]]. It is a well sized dark blue fishing trawler. 

The raiders in the cave have already cleared out however, and are boarded on [[Reggie Brown]]'s ship. They will use it to conduct a raid on [[Saddle-Port]] and then escape north. 
#### Reward:
The captain will offer anyone who returns his lock box half of what it contains -- a total sum of 500 gold of gems and jewels.

# Post Hooks:
Realistically, things get a little wishy-washy here. Both hooks are setup to have the party eventually get back to [[Saddle-Port]]. That would allow for a raid by members of [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]]. They would search for Librarians and stone masons, as described in [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. This means the raiders would target [[Vivian Lovejoy]] and maybe [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] (since they are both librarian-related).

The end-all, be all, is that there should be a combat where the party comes face to face with a force of [[The Followers of Karak-Ulgurath]] and the party is outmatched by this force.
