Regional Location: [[Mist]]
Subsection: Conquest of [[The Many]]

**The Plot**
- [[The Many]] were being hunted while on [[Mist]]
- They had done as much as they can to hide themselves here
- However great their inventions were, however great their architecture, they were found before they could fully activate the last of their creations
- The last two creations to activate were [[The Mist Codex]] and then [[The Aetherveil Projector]]
	- [[The Mist Codex]] would power and control their inventions autonomously 
	- [[The Aetherveil Projector]] would shroud and conceal [[Mist]] for a long time
- The forces of [[The Scintillating Order]] found [[Mist]] and attacked before these could be fully tested and activated
- A battle for days and days ensued
- The native people of [[Mist]], helped in their stay by [[The Many]] fought alongside [[The Many]]
- [[The Scintillating Order]] and its vast resources, funded from [[The Runewilds]] and the kingdoms therein fought on the other side
- [[The Many]] and their forces were out numbered on an unwinnable scale
- Their only recourse was to emergency activate their constructions without their needed testing's
- Most of [[The Many]] would die buying time for their devices to be activated
- [[Sprague]] would die alongside [[Marwood]] as they activated [[The Aetherveil Projector]]
- And [[Faustus]] would like to see his memory erased as he activated [[The Mist Codex]]
- The other members died/fought like this:
	- [[DeAngelo]] transformed into an ancient black dragon named [[Agnedelo the Plague-Bringer]] who, when the mind-blank came, reverted to a dragon's primal instinct and turned evil, generating [[The Umbrawood]]
	- [[Mansfield]] ...
	- [[Valentino]] ...
	- [[Cleophas]] ...
	- [[Bernhard]] ...
- Any who survived forgot who they were
- Their creations were sealed and their access codes forgotten to magic 
- [[The Scintillating Order]] was equally mind-wiped and would like alongside what member of [[The Many]] existed after that
- [[Mist]] would be rebuilt and this would be day one of history
- These contraptions, untested, would last for 1000 years before running out of power and failing
