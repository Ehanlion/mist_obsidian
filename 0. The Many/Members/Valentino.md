**Creating His [[Shard]]**
- [[Valentino]] worked on [[The Mist Codex]] and did a lot of rune programming to help build it
- he would have needed vast intelligence, focus, and rune carving abilities
- Hence he likely would have been a wizard
	- Intelligence -> increase by +2, up to a maximum of 22
	- History -> advantage
	- Arcana -> advantage
	- Spells he would use non-stop:
		- Detect Magic -> at will
		- Dispel Magic -> 1/Day
		- Identify -> at will
- Needs combat power too:
	- the [[Shard]] by design has 5 different color inlays:
		- red fire gem -> resistance to fire damage, melee attacks against wearer rebuke 1d6 fire damage
		- blue gem -> breathe underwater, swim speed equal to walking speed
		- white gem -> increase base movement speed by 10 ft
		- gold gem -> spell storage, hold up to 3 levels of spells in it
		- black gem -> dark vision to 300 ft, tremor sense for 15 ft. 
- These things need to be gated, everything here is at level 5, increases in power at level 9, level 13, level 17, and 20
- *Need the visions too though:*
	- *Note:* [[Valentino]] had to be here, he was defending the [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] from an onslaught while [[Faustus]] and [[Marwood]] worked to activate [[The Mist Codex]] which was hidden underneath [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
	- *Visions here:* 
		- they should feel interactive, as if you have to carry out the acts described below or do something to progress the vision
		- Only if you make it to the end does the [[Shard]] obey 
	- Sees a wide open battle field, ring is being worn. Figure wearing ring (which is the person who is having the vision), is powerful, lithe, and extinct feeling
	- sees a flying sky ship with ballista on its prow soaring in over the cliffs, the ring wearer downs the ship with a single spell as it plummets into the side of a cliff in a fireball 
	- Wearer is facing down an ancient red dragon one on one, and cannot kill it. They are mortally wounded and then teleport away. Vision conveys feeling that you have no more spell magic left and are about to die
	- Frantically writing down a final letter in the cipher text of [[The Many]] and laying the [[Shard]] to rest in the original compound underneath [[The High Forests]].
