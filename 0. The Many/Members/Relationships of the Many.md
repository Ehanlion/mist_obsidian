**The Idea**
- I have had the idea that members of the Many were in relationships with each other
- In theory, this makes sense, they were close proximity, high stress living and so many of the couples would have been naturally formed

I have the following puzzle pieces that I think will work well together
- [[Faustus]] and [[Marwood]] are *married*
- [[Mansfield]] and [[Sprague]] were *engaged*
- [[Bernhard]] and [[Valentino]] had just started *dating*
- [[DeAngelo]] and [[Cleophas]] loved each other but never got to realize it
# Relationships to Understand
1. [[Faustus]] and [[Marwood]]
2. [[Mansfield]] and [[Sprague]]
3. [[Bernhard]] and [[Valentino]]
4. [[DeAngelo]] and [[Cleophas]]
## 1. [[Faustus]] and [[Marwood]] (married)
- [[Faustus]] and [[Marwood]] have been married long before the event that lead [[The Many]] to [[Mist]]
- they were affectionately called "the couple" or "the parents" because they were the authority figures of [[The Many]] and just so happened to also be married 
## 2. [[Mansfield]] and [[Sprague]] (engaged)
- During their time in [[Mist]], [[Mansfield]] and [[Sprague]] fell in love quickly and were planning to get engaged
- Their wedding would have fallen just after the final battle for [[Mist]] in which everyone's minds were erased 
- They never got to live out their wedding
- Each one of them died with their vows being their last known words, captured by each of their [[Shard]]
## 3. [[Bernhard]] and [[Valentino]] (dating)
- Because of the close proximity on [[Mist]] and the high stress, [[Bernhard]] and [[Valentino]] often took on objectives together
- As such they spent much time in each other's company which led to them falling in love with each other
- By the time of the final battle, they had only been dating for a couple months 
- [[Bernhard]]'s [[Shard]] captured final thoughts of a first date
- [[Valentino]]'s [[Shard]] captured final thoughts of a family with [[Bernhard]]
## 4. [[DeAngelo]] and [[Cleophas]] (unrealized lovers)
- [[DeAngelo]] and [[Cleophas]] were the least closely exposed to each other's company on [[Mist]] since their objectives never really overlapped 
- However they were friends and messaged each other with disappearing paper notes and sending stones 
- They both were falling in love with each other, but before their could express this, the final battle arrived 
- Before their minds were wiped, both had written notes of love unknown to each other and died with them in their hands
- Both of their [[Shard]] captured frantic writing of a love confession, and acceptance in their final minutes
