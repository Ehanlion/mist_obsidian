# Description:
The shrouds are the barriers on the Mist-side of the field projected by the [[The Aetherveil Projector]]. They stop any ship from making it through them. If a ship sails close to them, the temperature drops to icy levels. Sailing further, you could encounter titanic abominations of the sea; frosty creatures knows as [[Frost-Bound Wardens]]. If a ship can sail through this, the veil will transport them to the other side of the island.

E.g. a ship enters the shroud from the north of the islands and manage to miraculously sail through the freezing waters. They sail out of the shrouds into the waters at the south of the island. 

# Getting past the Wardens:
The [[Frost-Bound Wardens]] are fearsome, gigantic titans. They are not to be trifled with. Even a party of max level characters would stand no chance against these beings. 
# Locations of the shrouds:
The shrouds is NOT centered on the center point of the island of Mist but rather it is centered on [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. For this reason, the borders of the shroud are a lot closer to both [[The Stormlocked Frontier]] and [[The Fractured Coast]]. This, combined with the natural occurrence of [[The Frozen Razor Fangs]] and [[The Infernal Razor Fangs]] makes [[The Chromatic Fangs]] the only way to travel to [[The Stormlocked Frontier]]. 

# Revising the Layers of the Mist
### Layer 1: Cold Mist
Layers of dense, swirling Mist freeze anything that dares to venture into it. After a long time, any creature or ship is covered in thick layers of ice.
### Layer 2: Navigation Failure
In this layer, your natural sense of direction fails; simply sailing in the same direction will fail you. This area is filled with [[Glisters]] as well. To get past, one must acquire [[Mistway Compass]]. 
### Layer 3: The Wardens
Name is evident: the [[Frost-Bound Wardens]] will destroy anything that comes through here. This is the last defense. No one will make it past.
### Layer 4: Modify Memory
If somehow the [[Frost-Bound Wardens]] are evaded, the Mist seeps into every pore of the body and attempts to erase the identity of the creatures. Treat this as casting a 9th level modify memory on each creature. It will erase any notion of the player travelling into the shrouds and what they experienced.
