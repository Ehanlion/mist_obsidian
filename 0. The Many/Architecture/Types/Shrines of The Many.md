Subsection: Variety of creation built by [[The Many]]
#### Descriptions
Shrines are powerful statues of [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]]. There are plenty of altars, fake shrines, temples, or monuments that normal people of [[Mist]] create to honor their chosen Divinity. While these can act as centers of community, places of belief, or centers to temples, they are often inauthentic. In actuality, these all have no magic despite what the people who pray to these shrines believe. In [[Mist]], there are rare occurrences of powerful Shrines, said to offer actual favors from the gods themselves. These are rare and hard to find. These shrines are in fact remnant [[Shrines of The Many]], and they were created ages ago to harness the power of the long ago banished gods. They are the only source of Divine interreference (although even this is faked by [[The Mist Codex]]). Although it is worth noting, divine connection does not solely originate from [[Shrines of The Many]]. The "popular belief" or the "group conscious" is what creates Divine Magic in the absence of [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]]. Owing favors, devotees, honor, and fear all play a role in society to allow [[The Mist Codex]] to manufacture a Divine Layer of Magic across [[Mist]] that anyone can tap into if they seek to. 
#### Creations
- [[The Many]] created [[The Divine Barrier]] to banish [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]] from [[Mist]]
- In doing so, they cutoff the connection from divinity to [[Mist]] and its inhabitants
- Since this would break Warlocks, Paladins, and Clerics, they created a way to *manufacture* divine magic

In the age of their creation, [[The Many]] banished [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]] behind what is called [[The Divine Barrier]]; this is an impregnable barrier against Divine presence on [[Mist]] and is upheld by the power of [[The Mist Codex]]. When banished, [[The Many]] siphoned (via [[The Mist Codex]] and the magic used for banishment) Divine Power to store in shrines that are now called the [[Shrines of The Many]]. They also harnessed existing remnants of the Divine power left behind by the Divinities to aid in the Shrines mass creation. Then, they tied the magic of these [[Shrines of The Many]] to [[The Mist Codex]] itself, allowing it to act through these shrines to create a plausibly-real facade for Divinities. 
##### How the Shrines Work
- The [[Shrines of The Many]] connect magically to [[The Mist Codex]]
- [[The Mist Codex]] is responsible for creating and replicating magic in [[Mist]]
- [[The Mist Codex]] generates "the weave" that spellcasters regard as "magic"
- [[The Mist Codex]] *mimics divine behavior* of each God, good or evil, and creates and Avatar of that God to portray
- When people connect with shrines, they tap into a direct connection to [[The Mist Codex]] and not the actual God
- [[The Mist Codex]] replicates powers and personality, recreating the divinity
#### The Shrines Themselves
- [[The Many]] created shrines to each of [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]]
- These shrines capture the Gods *original, divine power*
- They *do not* instill a true connections directly to the god themselves
- Rather the shrine is *imbued itself* with lingering magic of the God it derives from 
- Think of it like the following:
	- A god casts a spell to raise a pile of rocks as a golem servant
	- Then the god leaves town forever, never to return
	- The golem is still divine in nature as it was raised from nothing by the god themselves
	- But it does not have a connection to the God themselves, and it does not act as an instance of the God
	- Instead it stands as a lingering remnant of that god's power, harnessing divine magic but not being a Divine instance itself 
- So the shrines *are imbued with remnants* of true divine power, but they do not offer a connection to the actual God
- There is *no connection to any actual divinity* on [[Mist]]
