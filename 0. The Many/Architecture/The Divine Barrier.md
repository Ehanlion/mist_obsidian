Created by [[The Aetherveil Projector]].

Somehow, someway, [[The Many]] who created [[The Aetherveil Projector]] gave it the ability to block all divine presence on Mist. Divine influence is still possible e.g. clerics, warlocks, and paladins are still able to draw their power from divine sources. However, no divine deity can step foot on mist or show their form there. Only in dream and visions can they give their chosen champions glimpses of their visions. 

This barrier extends beyond just blocking deities from stepping foot on Mist; it blocks all interplanar connections on Mist. No portals to other realms, no pocket planes, no demi-planes, and such. Spells that move creatures across planar thresholds automatically fail.
