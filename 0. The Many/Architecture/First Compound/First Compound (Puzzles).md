##### Lost Waters Puzzle
**The Room:**
- A small chamber with two pits filled with sand on either side. 
- One side has dark, volcanic, black sand
- The other side has course sand that on closer inspection, is actually made of ground coral 
- The walls have mosaics:
	- On the volcanic sand side: A mosaic of [[The Many]] constructing something on the rim of a caldera in the mountains.
	- On the coral sand side: A mosaic of [[The Many]] constructing something of interest in a large inland cavern. On closer inspect, it appears to be [[The Sunken Caverns]], although it is not filled with water, as it is currently in modern [[Mist]]. 
- In the center is a cylindrical plinth, dormant right now.

> [!NOTE] Riddle
> When sweet meets salt, the balance lies,
> The sands must drink on what nature thrives,
> Of Fresh Brine and Sullied Sweet,
> Their clash reveals where answers meet.

**Solution:** Pour fresh water onto the coral sand size and pour salty water (or contaminated water) onto the volcanic sands side.
**Reward:** The Blue gemstone and part of the overall puzzle
##### Air Direction Puzzle
**The Room:**
- This room is an airy, large, open room with white columns from floor to ceiling, creating a circular arena looking area.
- Inside the arena is a large golden compass set into the ground.
- Air magically seems to blow up from the compass, swirling into the air.
- On the far wall is a mosaic and a glittering golden message.
- The Mosaic depicts 8 members of [[The Many]] standing atop a tall peak, their clothes swirling with wind as the sun rises in the distance. There is no [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]] present. 

> [!NOTE] Riddle
> From white-crested peaks, to singing plains,
> From dark tangled woods, to burning sands,
> From white tall cliffs, to starlit glades,
> From sequestered shores, to ice-cold waters.

Deciphered:
1. East to West
2. North-east to South
3. North-west to East
4. East to North

An air elemental forms in the room when players approach the puzzle. When a player hits the elemental, it moves its movement speed towards that creature. On its turn, it charges towards the closest player. The players need to move together, or just one at a time works too, to bait the air elemental to move from direction to direction. Each direction on the compass is 30 feet apart. You can hit the elemental, cause it to move to you, then move to the direction you want it to charge. Its a little confusing, just make it work.

**Solution:** The air elemental makes four consecutive charges from direction to direction completing the puzzle.
**Reward:** The White gemstone and part of the overall puzzle
##### The Firelight Puzzle
**The Room:**
- This room is a very small chamber.
- It is pure darkness, not magical darkness, there is just no light in the room
- There is a metal door in the center of the room, it has no keyhole.
- Across the room is a single alcove with a message on it. 
- There is a mosaic on the floor of this room: If lit up, it depicts 8 members of [[The Many]] outside the base of a mountain facing a cave entrance, another part of the mosaic shows them searching the depths of the caves. One member holds a torch, the others do not. 

> [!NOTE] Riddle
> Alcove message: "I am married to the guardian of treasure"
> The answer is "Key" (the guardian of treasure is a lock, a key is married to the lock to access treasure)

The metal door has no lock and stands in the middle of the room.
If firelight is ignited and a shadow is cast, the shadow has a keyhole in it.
Place the key into the keyhole. 

**Solution:** Ignite and cast any firelight on the door while standing on the mosaic part which depicts the holding of a torch. Then with the light, place the key from the riddle into the keyhole from the shadow of the door. This shadow is cast on a wall, the keyhole is on a wall, this opens a door into the wall to reveal a metal cylinder with the gemstone.

- It depicts 8 members of [[The Many]]
- Two of them are much closer to circular bulwark in the wall.
- The two members, one male one female, are flanking the Bulwark, seemingly holding hands
- The Bulwark has 5 empty slots running vertically down it. 
- The door is not part of the mosaic and is real, although it cannot be opened without the gemstones.
- The empty slots run vertically and are each colored in order:
	- *White gemstone - white indent*
	- *Red gemstone - red indent*
	- *Blue gemstone - blue indent*
	- *Gold gemstone - golden indent*
	- *Black gemstone - black indent*
- When they are placed, a simply line of text appears as if melding out of the stone.
	- Text: "Speak that which motivates us 8"
	- Answer: "Fear"
	- They must put together the word clues and then apply a Caesar's cipher of 5 to decode them. 
- If the gemstones are placed and the word "Fear" spoken aloud, the door opens.
