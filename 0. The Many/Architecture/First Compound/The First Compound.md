Regional Location: [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: First compound of [[The Many]], located under [[The Widow-maker's Stands]]

**Description**
- Basic with *clean cut and precise* stone passages and simple rooms.
- Hallways and rooms are decorated with *mosaics* depicting the early days of [[The Many]] as they made [[Mist]] their home. While they were hunted and deeply military, there are plenty of instances of warmth and humanity, hence the bounty of mosaics. 
- The areas of [[The First Compound]] that were created by [[The Many]] are exact. 
- The areas of [[The First Compound]] that were created from mining by [[The Aquan Nations]] are rough, a clear sign that they were created quickly and with rough labor. 
- *Scents*: aromatic spice aromas from the areas with [[Fedorov's Legion]], potent fish smell from the areas with [[The Aquan Nations]], sulphiric odors from the hot springs, stagnant wood from the storages areas, pungent cooking scents from the kitchens, and musty odors of decay from the cages holding the entrapped miners. 

This dungeon should feel like it has *two levels*. Firstly, there are the obvious lived-in areas from staked-out members of [[Fedorov's Legion]] and the numerous sea creatures of [[The Aquan Nations]]. But beneath that there is the distinct sense that this is a compound, not a cave, and its creation was deliberate and exact, indicative of highly knowledgeable and powerful architects. Whether or not its precise passages were hewn by hand or with magic cannot be inferred. 

**Original Purpose**
- *Basic Living* - Make sure there are descriptions of what once could have been bedroom, kitchens, food storage, pantries, and common areas. Also include bathing and hygiene such as water sources. 
- *Simple Planning* - Rooms for planning meetings and mapping, hence the map room and training areas.
- *Initial Concept Testing* - Test teleportation circle, simple puzzle rooms and vaults for the wedding ring. 

**Core Loot**
- [[Coral Lance]] - on a martial, maybe a baron
- [[Siren's Locket]] - on a caster, cold damage
- [[Pendant of the Leviathan]] - on a caster
- [[Lantern of Revealing]] - [[Fedorov's Legion]] item
- [[Red Rock Pipe]] - [[Fedorov's Legion]] item
- [[Simple Runic Prayer Mat]] - [[Fedorov's Legion]] item
- *The Wedding ring:* Reward for solving the 5 puzzle rooms and opening the main door
	- Solving the puzzle that leads to the single main door, the players will be rewarded with a *note, a name, and two powerful magic rings*. 
	- These rings are wedding rings left behind. 
	- The couple alluded to is [[Bernhard]] and [[Valentino]]. This compound's entrance is the name [[Valentino]] in cipher text, so this compound was originally created by [[Bernhard]], hence [[Valentino]] as the password. The rings found would have been created by [[Bernhard]] for their marriage, 
	- [[Valentino]]'s name is not mentioned directly in the text
	- The note would be to [[Valentino]] and from [[Bernhard]].
	- There are two rings that are found, created by [[Bernhard]] for both her and [[Valentino]]. 

**Combat**
- Make sure combats are isolated, unique, and simple.
- Keep fights out of the hallways unless they happen to run into a patrol.
- Make sure patrols are basic Sahuaguin only with a max of one specialized troop of [[The Aquan Nations]]. Do not reinforce groups that are encountered in this way.
- Clearly telegraph if an enemy is trying to retreat and get help. They should try to stop this. Loose ends are loose ends, but it is up to me to telegraph them easily and let the group handle them.  
- Do not add too many gimmicks and for an area, always telegraph the gimmicks ahead of time with description read-aloud text for the group.
- Make sure areas allow for time to breath between encounters.
- If areas are close together, ramp up the pressure. If they rest when they shouldn't punish this with a roving ambush of a few small grunts. 
- All fights result in some lootables, at minimum gold or simple potions, at best a magic item or two. 
- They will use fireball, make sure it doesn't burn an entire room. Keep stuff in iron chests or in protected alcoves. Fire can destroy some stuff but not everything. 

**Exploration**
- Ensure that every room has:
	- A combat or an encounter
	- A tidbit of lore or information to help in the dungeon
	- A puzzle to solve or an obstacle to overcome
	- Something the group has to deliberate to work around
