**The Main Goal**
- [[The Many]] are a powerful order of Mages
- Their creations were built for the following reasons:
	- *Defense* - they were protecting themselves against [[The Scintillating Order]] and their incursions 
		- They should be hard to access 
		- There should be password/keys/methods to gain access
	- *Longevity* - these structures were designed to last a long time
		- These structures should feel durable and overbuilt 
	- *Control* - these structures are designed to give [[The Many]] mastery over the environment in every possible way
		- Magic control
		- Divine control
		- Environment control
- Their creations fall under the following easy categories:
	- *Monuments* - largest category, anything minor or majors that has a techno-magical purpose. These usually are activated and manipulated to create a magical effect or creation. [[The Mist Codex]], [[The Aetherveil Projector]] are both examples of (albeit more powerful) monuments. 
	- *Shrines* - cloned powers of [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]], embedded into shrines. Unlike false shrines, these larger creations of [[The Many]] embody true, raw powers of the old gods. The divine magic is still manufactured by [[The Mist Codex]], but these shrines are actual conduits of that power. Other shrines are just folksy places of worship and carry no real power.
	- *Compounds* - defensive or functional hidden structures created by [[The Many]]. Usually created as strongholds, defensive points, secret bases, and places to sequester away the daily practices of [[The Many]]. 
- We need effectively a hierarchy of "things" 

List the potential structures from hardest to access to easiest to access

Realistically, I have not introduced any of the monuments apart from one compound of [[The Many]]
That means I essentially THEY know nothing about any of these
So I have the freedom to do anything I want with these structures 
Don't feel like because you are doings something one way, it can't be redone into another

**What I think they know**
They know that there is A GROUP, called [[The Many]]
They don't know specifics
They know they regard [[Mist]] as a "Sanctuary"
There are clues regarding [[The Many]] with [[The Tent of Many Things]]
Maybe they know that [[The Tent of Many Things]] is related to [[Faustus]]
There is a letter FROM [[Marwood]] to someone in [[The Tent of Many Things]]
They know [[The Tent of Many Things]] reveals things with key phrases
[[The Tent of Many Things]] has controls for Magic and Cloaking (defense)

**Some Ideas:**

The Eight Gate: -> leads to [[The Mist Codex]]
- Guardian of the 8 gate
- Requires all 8 [[Shard]]
- Guardian only fightable when all 8 shards inputted
- This is like a vast gateway down into [[The Mist Codex]]
- Locate it in the mountains and have it be known about maybe?
- Either of the following:
	- it is known about, and there are tons of dead bodies from people who tried to enter
		- this could be cool to have it be some ritual?
		- maybe people don't know what it really is, but it could be a ritual challenge to get to the center and back without being killed by the guardian 
	- it is more known about, but still secret, talk to the right person and they can guide you
	- it is super secret, very few know, and it is a well hidden temple-style place

We need to find better resting places for the remaining [[Shard]]
- one is going to be easy to find, and in the first compound
- another will be in [[The Sunken Caverns]]
- One was TEASED to be in [[Smears-burrow]] and with the Grung but I think we silently ret-con this to be just some shit from the Grung
- That means we have 6 left
- We should place one in every major region, so with 2 already placed:
	- 2 in [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]
		- 1 in the first compound ([[The Aquan Nations]])
		- 1 in [[The Sunken Caverns]] ([[Karak-Ulgurath]] and [[The Aquan Nations]])
	- 2 in [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]
		- 1 in [[The Starwoods]] ([[The Green Order]])
		- 1 in [[The Umbrawood]] ([[The Umbral Cabal]])
	- 2 in [[The Chromatic Fangs]]
		- 1 in [[The Frigid Crucible]] ([[Gar Imladris Crossing]])
		- 1 in [[The Scorvorian Peaks]] ([[Scorvorria the Ember Greatwyrm]])
	- 1 in [[The Scorchsand Wastes]]
	- 1 affixed and bound to a creature somewhere ??? OR already placed in *The Eight Gate*

Then everything is effectively a clue
Every single thing should give a clue about the following:
1. *Function* - what is can do, who used it, what magic does it possess, what is it used for?
2. *Form* - what it looks like, hints about who might wield it
3. *Location* - hints to specific location to find, hints about what might guard it, clues about puzzles
4. *Lore* - who wielded, what used for, when it was sealed away
