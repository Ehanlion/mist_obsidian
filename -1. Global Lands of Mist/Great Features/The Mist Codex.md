# Description:
The Mist Codex is a 'computer,' essentially an archaic control console, that accepts the [[Shards]] (keys) of Mist as control inputs to control the [[The Aether-Veil Projector]]. All of the [[Shards]] are required to allow the codex to function. 
# Activating the Codex:
# Controls for the Codex:
There are multiple different control interfaces for how the codex can be used. There exists and interface for planar-interactions, [[The Shrouds of the Frost-Bound Wardens]], [[Frost-Bound Wardens]], and arcanum.

#### Planar Interaction: 24
Inhibitors for all of the planes of existence can be enabled and disabled using this control interface. In general the interface is enabling/disabling **inhibitors of each plane.**

Each part of the tree has its own runic interface that, when all of the 8 [[Shards]] are inserted into the Mist Codex, can be toggled on or off. If the rune is toggled 'on' that means it is blocking that plane.
#### Divine Interactions: 2
The [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] is able to block the presence of any non-mortal creature from setting their foot on the island of Mist. It is also able to block all non-mortal communication to the island as well, but [[The Many]] were religious so they chose to allow the communication so that they could pray and be answered by their gods. [[The Many]] had members who prayed to both [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]], since [[The Many]] were an enlightened bunch and could see through the deceptions of the deities. 

The barrier created by [[The Aether-Veil Projector]] is called [[The Divine Barrier]] (it is also called this by the people of Mist, probably because it is the reasonable name for such a thing) and it blocks both physical presence and could block communication as well.
