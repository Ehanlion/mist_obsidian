Subsection: Slave rock of [[Master Mind Rock]], created by magic when a [[Master Mind Rock]] is created

The Mind Rock is a slave stone of a [[Master Mind Rock]]. There can exist multiple Mind Rocks, slaved to one [[Master Mind Rock]].

The Mind Rock gives any creature with the [[Master Mind Rock]] authority over the creature. 

Applying the Mind Rock requires it to be touched to a creature. That creature then makes a Charisma Saving Throw versus a DC 18. If it fails, the Mind Rock melds with the creature, and it becomes a minion of whomever wields the [[Master Mind Rock]] that controls it.

To destroy the Mind Rock takes 30 Force damage in one attack. It has an AC of 18.
