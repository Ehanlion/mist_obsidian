**Idea**
- I like the idea that if [[Mist]] is freed from [[The Mist Codex]] and [[The Aetherveil Projector]] is disabled all hell breaks loose
- [[The Scintillating Order]] would exact revenge, not only on any who hold a [[Shard]] but also [[Mist]] itself
- They could do the following

**Regime**
- A harsh regime is in control of [[Mist]]
- Freedom fighters struggle to break the control of this regime on [[Mist]] but with little luck
- Since [[The Many]] used spellcasting to orchestrate much of what [[The Scintillating Order]] deems to be murder and crime, they ban magic
- Structures are created around [[Mist]] that act as God's Eye kind of shit, they can detect the casting of an spell higher level than a cantrip and even a cantrip
	- Roll for cantrips on a D20, 1,2,3 and it is detected
	- All other spells are auto-detected and a mark is placed upon the caster
	- The Mark is a modified hunter's mark
	- Constructs of the regime will now hunt the caster to death
- This creates a situation where:
	- most people, especially those who fight back are martials not mages
	- magic is rare and if it is a gift a person once had, it is well hidden 

**The Dampers**
- a harsh regime installs dampers around [[Mist]]
- These break the weave, isolating [[Mist]] from a connection to the Weave, and by extension all magic
- Those who were casters lose their ability to cast
- This could be a cool setting to have *shadow magic powers*
	- Each character is martial, but I tell them that they all have a secret other class level for free on top of their character
	- I create this at the start
	- It could be either magical or divine in nature, either would work but it would be cool to choose one and then have it subtly effect the character 
	- They could THINK it is magic, and I could make them believe it is magic, but only a couple of them might have it
	- I can basically use that single level's class features covertly while they play the character to build a sense of fear and mystery into them
	- Essentially use class features almost as intended when their character does something and use them to try and help them
	- This could trigger the stuff from the regime above or something bad idk yet but cool concept

Essentially, I want to hard force a world without magic
This is both learned, inherited, and divine magic
And then I can give them subtly class features secretly from either a magical or a divine source
