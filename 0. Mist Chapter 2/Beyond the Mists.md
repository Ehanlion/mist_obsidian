# Questions
1. What does the future of [[Mist]] hold?
2. What books do I need to reference next?
3. What changes will be introduced?
4. When do we trigger the next chapter?

**The Future of Mist**
- advanced, cyberpunk + spelljammer world
- flying space vessels, planar travels, high magic setting

**What Books are Needed?**
- Spelljammer
- Planescape  

**When do we Progress to Chapter 2?**
- Chapter 2 is activated the moment [[The Mist Codex]] is deactivated
	- At this time the following happens
	- [[The Mist Codex]] deactivating breaks down [[The Aetherveil Projector]] exposing [[Mist]]
	- [[The Mist Codex]] deactivating breaks down [[The Divine Barrier]] allowing divine Vengance on [[Mist]]
	- [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]] take vengeance on [[Mist]] for being trapped
	- Two potential things then happen:
		- If any of [[The Many]]'s kin by blood (which is possible) live, [[The Scintillating Order]], in its modern form, annihilate these lifeforms entirely. In this scenario, [[The Scintillating Order]] will not directly fight the gods, but will not rise to fight against them
		- If none of [[The Many]]'s kin by blood live, [[The Scintillating Order]] will immediately begin rescue operations on [[Mist]], since the remainder of the inhabiting creatures would be, by deduction, descendants of [[The Scintillating Order]]'s forces who were stranded on [[Mist]] when [[The Mist Codex]] was activated. In this scenario, [[The Scintillating Order]] directly enters open warfare with [[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]]. 
	- [[The Scintillating Order]] and [[The Runewilds]] are the reasons for progessing to a more advanced age.
	- They have the technology and the developments to support spelljammer ships, advanced weapons (like guns), and advanced intelligence (like warforged and spelljammer creatures)
