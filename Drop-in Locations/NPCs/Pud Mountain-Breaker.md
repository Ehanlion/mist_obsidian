A tall, beefy-looking half-orc. He does not look to be wearing very many clothes, save for a belt with a fiery face of a giant and a kilt, adorned with small charms. Love to talk about his past adventures and his home tribe, of which he loves very much. Works as a bartender in the [[The Quaint and Rustic II]] with his past adventuring friend, [[Rexire Stormfellow]]. 

**Appearance:**
-  Tall, with huge, dense muscles and too many scars to count.
-  Nearly 6'6". Muscles are very apparent with the lack of upper-body clothing. Has close cut white hair and dark blue skin. Eyes are a deep, dark brown.
-  Wears a belt of fire giant strength, and a dark red kilt. The kilt is adorned with charms, small trinkets and various doo-dads:
	-  A miniature knife, given to him by a talking squirrel he saved. 
	-  A gold bear's tooth.
	-  Multiple, multi-colored gems that were given to him by the sooth-sayer of his tribe to give luck and fortune. 
	-  3 Tassels, one from each of his brothers, all burnt at the ends.

**Motives**:
-  Love to talk about his past adventures. Has tons of tails to tell.
-  Has a deep, long spanning connection with his tribe and his father. One day he hopes to return, once he has built a fantastic enough tale, to his tribe to regale them with his travels and to follow his father in leading their tribe.
-  Will always take on a physical duel, be that wrestling, arm wrestling, sparring,  you name it.
-  Don't challenge him to a drinking contest. He will win. Don't test it. 
-  Enthusiastic to play [[Black-wing's Duels]], due to it being the only gambling game he has won at.
