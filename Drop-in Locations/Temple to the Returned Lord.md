**The Temple of the Returned Lord, Art is AI Generated:**![[Temple to the Returned Lord.png]]
A grand mausoleum of an ancient deity, now the home of a returned zombie lord whos' arcane rituals raise the dead *in his image*. The zombie lord rebuilding this temple is called [[Morghoul the Resurrected Sovereign]] and he serves an undead god, named [[Necroxus, the Shrouded Dominion]].

**The surrounding forest:**
-  The trees rot with a decaying scent. Their bark peels to reveal that the once oaky and living wood is petrified and black. Their sap drips a dark, glowing blue. The mist here seems to whisper as if you are being called to from beyond the veil.
	-  If players listen to the winds and make a DC 12 Perception check, they can hear chants of the Zombie Lord's name: [[Morghoul the Resurrected Sovereign]].
		-  The souls whispering to the players are not a friend of Morghoul's, in fact they are unwillingly bound to him. *If a player rolls above a 20 on their perception check* OR beats a DC 14 Insight check, they hear the clanking of chains amidst the voices of the spirts and understand they are unwillingly bound. 
		-  A player who can figure out how to free the spirts will be a friend to the spirits trapped hear, and gain the ability [[Toll of the Unbound Spirits]].
		-  A little info: These spirts are the *Blue* spirts, and they are past adventurers, heroes, and innocents trapped by the temple. Their chants of Morghoul's name are out of resentment and they wish to be free.
	-  If the players rest here, their dreams are invaded by darker spirts of the undead, who's strong presence in the area allows them to curse those who are sleeping.
		-  Resting players, in their sleep must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or suffer [[The Whisperer's Curse]]. You can only repeat the save if you exit the forest of the temple. 
		-  If a player attempts to communicate with the darker spirits in their dreams, have them roll an appropriate check (it should be around DC 15-16). A success causes the player to realize these spirits serve 
		-  A little info: These spirts are the *Black* spirits. They serve Morghoul directly and have no desire to be free. They are chaotic and evil and seek to rend all living things in their new domain deceased. 

**The temple at a glance:**
-  The first and easiest thing to notice is that the temple is being reconstructed. Ghostly apparitions and blue, arcane runes float in the air lifting and enchanting stone blocks to rebuild parts of the temple. 
	-  Looking closer at the runes shows that they are Necromantic in magical type. 
-  Their are many, stone pillars with glowing spheres on them surrounding the temple. 
	-  Examining these, on a DC 10 arcana check, will reveal that the magic is NOT necromancy as would be expected of an undead lord's magic, but rather illusory magic. The *Unlocking the Crypt* puzzle describes how the patten of disabling the pillars related to opening the crypt doors. 
-  The temple is made from dark black stones. It has a prominent double door entrance flanked by two translucent beings. 
	-  These guys are called "Allips" and a ghostly, misty apparitions with magical attacks. They cannot be reasoned with and attack any *living* thing. 
-  A perception check beating a DC 15 will reveal to that player a crypt entrance, low down, on either side of a massive, wide stone stair case leading to the double doors. It is unclear no matter what they roll, if this is a locked or unlocked entrance. 
	-  Examining these closer will reveal both are, in fact, locked. A DC 10 arcana check will confirm that, like the pillars above, the magic surrounding them is Illusory and not Necromantic. 
	-  The seals on the doors are identical, and they show a pattern described later in the *Unlocking the Crypt* puzzle.
	-  Just observing them makes it clear that they have not been opened in a *long* time and players can be certain that no one, not even Morghoul, have opened them yet.
