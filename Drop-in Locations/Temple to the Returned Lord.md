**The Temple of the Returned Lord, Art is AI Generated:**![[Temple to the Returned Lord.png]]
A grand mausoleum of an ancient deity, now the home of a returned zombie lord whos' arcane rituals raise the dead *in his image*. The zombie lord rebuilding this temple is called [[Morghoul the Resurrected Sovereign]] and he serves an undead god, named [[Necroxus, the Shrouded Dominion]].

# The Surrounding Forest:
*The trees rot with a decaying odor. Their once living bark peels back to reveal the blackened and petrified wood beneath. The once amber sap, is crystallized into glowing blue shards, gripping the sides of the trunks.*
- If players listen to the winds and make a DC 12 Perception check, they can hear chants of the Zombie Lord's name: [[Morghoul the Resurrected Sovereign]].
	-  The souls whispering to the players are not a friend of Morghoul's, in fact they are unwillingly bound to him. *If a player rolls above a 20 on their perception check* OR beats a DC 14 Insight check, they hear the clanking of chains amidst the voices of the spirts and understand they are unwillingly bound. 
		-  A player who can figure out how to free the spirts will be a friend to the spirits trapped hear, and gain the ability [[Toll of the Unbound Spirits]].
		-  A little info: These spirts are the *Blue* spirts, and they are past adventurers, heroes, and innocents trapped by the temple. Their chants of Morghoul's name are out of resentment and they wish to be free.
-  If the players rest here, their dreams are invaded by darker spirts of the undead, who's strong presence in the area allows them to curse those who are sleeping.
		-  Resting players, in their sleep must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or suffer [[The Whisperer's Curse]]. You can only repeat the save if you exit the forest of the temple. 
		-  If a player attempts to communicate with the darker spirits in their dreams, have them roll an appropriate check (it should be around DC 15-16). A success causes the player to realize these spirits serve 
		-  A little info: These spirts are the *Black* spirits. They serve Morghoul directly and have no desire to be free. They are chaotic and evil and seek to rend all living things in their new domain deceased. 

# The Temple at a Glance
Read if players see the temple:
*The temple stands, dark and foreboding. You can see remnants of a living forest, growing on the temple. New, massive black stones are being lifted into place by incorporeal beings. Each stone has glowing runes on it that pulse as they are placed into their new homes, then disappear. *

Key features:
-  Large stone double doors look like the only entrance.
-  DC 12 Perception reveals a vine-covered crypt door to the side of the main entrance.
-  The temple is surrounded by 7 large stone obelisks. They are used for the puzzle later.
-  DC 10 Arcana shows the runes inscribed on the obelisks are evocations runes. 
-  [[Morghoul the Resurrected Sovereign]] resides within the main chamber, just past the double doors. The inside of the temple is one large room. The ceilings are vaulted with pillars lining the room.
