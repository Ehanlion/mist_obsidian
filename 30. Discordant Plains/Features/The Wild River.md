# Description:
The Wild River lives up to its name -- it's wild. In parts its fearsome flow rages over submerged stones, creating dangerous and perilous rapids. In other parts, the river widens and amidst the river grass, fish make their homes. In some parts the river is merely a few feet deep and hundreds of feet wide. In others, it rushes rapidly through channels just 20 feet wide but that gouge hundreds deep.
