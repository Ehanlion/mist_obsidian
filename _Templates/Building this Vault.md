Start with the map.
Build locations and regions.
Build towns, cities, odd things, in each region.
Write sensory descriptions for each region.
Add some lore about locations on the map.
Add seasonal events that occur in each region.
- [ ] STOP! Do you have a map where if you point at a location on it, you can reference a note describing that location. Could you describe any part of the map to a player if they ask for it. Do you have events that you could use to fill the year with?

Add characters to each region.
Just add a couple notable characters for bigger locations.
Create a random name check list and a sub-folder for generated characters.
Have a separate name list for each region.
- [ ] STOP! Can you create an NPC in a region if a player asks to talk to a random person? Do you have a couple major characters for each region?

Develop quests.
Start with a welcome quest and a quest line to follow it.
- [ ] STOP! Can you play through an initial quest with your players to fill multiple session? Is there opportunity for them to deviate from that quest line with side quests that also subtly allow them to further the main quest? Does this first series of tasks lead into a larger set of events.
