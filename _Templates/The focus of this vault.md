Start at a high level. The first thing that needs to come are the locations. You need a few key locations in each part of the island. Make sure there are towns, a couple cities, forts. Give the landscape flavor. Each part of the island then needs to have a good description and a feeling. 

Checkpoint, can you feel every part of the island? Does each region have a feeling? Can you smell it, feel it, see it, visualize it? Can you see the island? If you can't, keep fucking working. If you can see it all and feel it all, then you can move on.

Add some groups of people. Don't focus on making large overall plots. Just focus on adding groups here and there. You can see the island. Now you have to hear the island. You have to give it people. 

Checkpoint, each region should have a group. Or multiple groups. You should be able to think about talking to these groups. Each one should have a specific feeling. 

To-do: villains, and a plot.
