This vault contains regions, with locations/events/features/towns in each region. Here is how each should expect to be formatted.

# Events Folder
Contains regional events that occur. These are environmental effects, specific effects to do with a location, and just general global events needed to add flavor to the world.

# Features Folder
Contains feature e.g. non-towns/non-city structures and places in the world. Anything that is not explicitly a town or city is added into the features folder. 

# NPCs Folder
This folder contains **major** NPCs. Locations can have LOCAL NPCs that ARE NOT documented in this folder -- that is because those NPCs are smaller and only local to the location listed. They are not linkable and are only textually described within the file they are mentioned in.

Local NPCs can 'graduate' to NPCs documented in the NPCs Folder if the players interact with them enough. Then they should be added to the folder and linked to from the file where they were originally mentioned. 

NPCs documented in the NPCs Folder are considered **major** NPCs, and have importance beyond just the location that they can be found in. They will be linkable.

# Towns, Cities Folder
This folder contains documentation of all towns and cities located within a specific region. These are specifically towns and cities and nothing else. These locations are described in full within their specific files. 

# Regional Description File
Every folder has a regional description file, titled to match the name of the overall folder. These files are NOT locations -- they are instead just descriptions of the overall region. They will have images, feelers texts, and evocative statements used to describe general travel through the region. They can be cited during travel days to add some descriptive flavor to each region.
