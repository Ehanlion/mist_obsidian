> [!NOTE] My realization to building locations
> Okay universe, it is 8/9/2024, I am about to run [[Mist S12 8-9-24]] and I realized, that while I was prepping some side-questing and locations, that I really felt overwhelmed by the notion of building locations well. It was the idea that they would be poorly created or ever too well created to the point of being a sinkhole of my time. So I decided to read through Tal'Dorei Reborn by Matt Mercer and look at how he build, not just towns, but organizations, pantheons, governments, and characters into his world. 
# Breaking down Tal'Dorei Reborn
Okay so the beginning portion of the book deals with gods, the pantheon ([[The Prime Deities]] and [[The Betrayer Gods]], of which I had copied), and factions. I will break these down in order as follows.
# Faction Breakdown - By Matt Mercer
## Tal'Dorei Council (Example)
### History and Group Description
This is sort of a weird section.
The *primary purpose* is to highlight the description of the organization
This involves knowing why the group exists and who founded it.
Make sure to highlight *the why of existence* for the group - why is it here, and what does it want?
In general this section is more *narrative* than the other sections, which contain denser information. 
Think of this section as a scholar reading you the history of the faction because you asked. 
### Faction Goals
A firm set of goals that the entire faction lives by. 
This should be high level and generic, but still something specific to the faction itself. 
### Relationships
Usually kept short and sweet. 
Details in here on *what other factions think of this faction*
Details in here on *what this faction thinks of other factions*
We just need a short synopsis to easily refer to and say "how does x-arbitrary-order feel about this faction and why do they feel that way?"
If you can get this info in two sentences, then everything is good. 
### Figures of Interest
A list of important figures relevant to the order. 
The key part is that here, *if they are listed, they are important if they aren't then make them up on the fly and don't worry about it.*
The key players in a faction are the named one, everyone else can be ad-libbed with a race-name table. 
Example:

**Name of the Character**
*Race, occupation title*
5-7 sentence block description about the character. Include a 1 sentence physical appearance section to be used as a hyper-quick reference. 

Format-wise, use a callout to do this neatly and then pull the actual character out and separate into new note and reference with a `![[Name of the Note to Reference]]` line in the main note. 

> [!NOTE] Name of the Character
> *Race, Title*

> Description goes in here ... 
> Description goes in here ...
