> *At first they started small: a couple fishermen disappeared at sea, some men went to work on their ship and were never heard from again, a group going into the tidal pools vanished without a trace. This happened all along the north coast. One day, while coming back from a bar, some men claim to have seen living fish running towards the white cliffs, dragging some people from the village. The town recovered of course, but those people were never heard from again. Kind of weird if you ask me* - **Someone from the local bar**

This mission starts with the party learning about the random, seemingly out-of-no-where vanishings from [[The North-West Highlands]], along the North Coast.
