# Mission Overview:
A task issued by [[The Green Order]] in order to become on of their ranks. It is the only way for a non-druidic, non-elvish person to be accepted as a native member, or at the very least a friendly, of the Green Order.

#### Issuing the Mission:
	You are trespassing adventurers. Stand down or your bodies will lay amongst the trees until you feed them. Threats aside, we mean you no harm if you mean none to us.

The party will not be allowed into the Green Order's dominion as long as [[The Green Order]] is aware of their trespassing. As soon as them become aware (from scrying spells, performed by [[Elder Thistleton]]), a confrontation party is sent out to intercept the group. 

If the group stands down, or seems friendly/compliant, whomever confronts them will offer them a way to be accepted within [[The Green Order]]'s dominion. This will involve the following mission, proposed as the following:

	We can offer you a fate better than death or denial adventurers. Become one with the forest, since you so clearly lack a connection to nature. Learn to be one with the animals, learn how to use the bountiful plants, or conjure magic of nature. Learn from the environment an aspect of nature and upon our grounds you can trod uncontested. You would be welcomed as one of us. 

The party will seek to learn about the heritage of the Green Order through trials of the forest. Their meta-gaming goal will be to learn aspects of the Druid class. Guide them towards one of the following categories.
-  Animal shaping and behavior
-  Nature and plant skills, used for potion making
-  Conjuring of nature-related spells

# Studying Animals (Wild Shape Training):
List of Animals within [[The North-East Forests]] (allowable for Wild-Shape, sorted by CR):

| Creature | Challenge Rating |
|----------|----------|
| Wolf    | CR 1/4  |
| Reindeer   | CR 1/4   |
| Panther | CR 1/4 |
| Giant Snail | CR 1/4 |
| Giant Wolf-Spider | CR 1/4 | 
| Elk | CR 1/4 |
| Dire Wolf | CR 1 |
| Brown Bear | CR 1 |
| Giant Rocktopus (special) | CR 1 |
| Moonbounder | CR 1 |

#### Players Selecting a Creature:
Have the players roll a History check or something to try and deduce what kind of animals could be found in the [[The Twilight Woods]]. This is NOT a full list, but it is a good couple that the player could refer to. 

#### Selecting Creature Difficulties:
A note on difficulty: A CR 1/4 creature is easier to emulate than a CR 1 creature. If setting DCs, they should be a little higher for CR 1 and the number of success required (if thinking in terms of a skill check challenge) should be slightly higher for the task list below.

#### Selecting Creature 'Tasks':
I am NOT going to write the *exact* list of tasks that a player would need to emulate for each individual creature and rather stick to a list of generic tasks that are generalized. Create tasks on the fly depending on circumstance. This will require flexing of DM muscles. 

#### General Task List

| Task | Task Description |
|----------|----------|
| Movement | Learn how to move like the creature by completing a series of **stealth, acrobatics, and athletics checks** to replicate their movements.
| Survival | Follow the creature as it forages, learn what plants it prefers and which it hates, use **nature, survival, and perception checks** to complete this.
| Fighting | Learn how to fight like the creature by emulating its attacks and strategies. This task should place the player character in a 1v1 with an animal that is also fighting the chosen creature. The two 1v1s should occur at the same time with the followed creature acting first in its battle.
| Caring | Learn how to take care of the creatures young by watching how the creature acts with them and provides for them. If the creature feeds its young, the player makes an **animal handling check**, done with advantage if the **survival task from earlier is completed.** |

# Reward:
If the player complete the challenge they get the Moon Druid ability to wild shape into the chosen animal as a bonus action. They can do this once per long rest. They can choose to learn new animals, but only if at a different time they repeat the steps they took to get here.

# Studying Nature and Plants:
Refer to [[Potions Ingredients, Harvestable]] and  [[Potion Ingredients, Forageable]] for the full lists of gatherable ingredients. This challenge takes place within the [[The Twilight Woods]], so will pull out a small subset of the list to use for this mission. 

#### Selecting the Searchable Ingredients:
Refer to the [[Potion Ingredients, Forageable]] and the [[Potions Ingredients, Harvestable]] lists for ingredients that can be found. Refine this down to a subset using the following guidelines:
- Plants here should rely on twilight, not full darkness, not full light to grow.
- They should feel whimsical and magical. 
- It is damp and moist here. Not hot. Nothing that would need direct light and a hot atmosphere here.
- No bold creatures. They should skulk and slink. 
- Creatures need to rely on darkvision and twilight to hunt.

Refer to [[Potion Ingredients by Environment]] to see what ingredients. Refer to the ingredients, forageable and harvestable, under the Forest sub-section. 

#### Choosing the Ingredients:
These are the ingredients that can be found. Refer to [[Potion Ingredients by Environment]] and search for anything that can be found in the forest. 

#### Making the Challenge Not Just Checks:
The ingredients are both the focus and not the focus. They are the *reason* that the player will be searching but not the main entertainment. Every ingredient should have a **discoverable component to it** that makes finding it easier and more interesting.

| The Idea | Further Detail |
| -------- | ----------| 
| The Ingredient is Food. | This ingredient is the favorite food of some animal. A clump of it just got eaten in your vision but you saw the animal that did it still looked hungry. |
| Into Light | This ingredient can only be harvested in certain moon phases or under moon lights or if it is warmed by torch light. |
| To Poison or Not to Poison. | This ingredient is indentical to another, but the other is a deadly toxin. Only by mixing the ingredient with another, bathing it in a stream, or doing something to it, can you find out if what you harvested is poison or safe. |
| Bribery | This ingredient is prized by a small group. To get some, it is often easier to bribe them with gold, another plant, or a small task that they could order you to complete. |
| Treatise | Yes, this ingredient is hard to find, but locations of growths of it are documented because of how rare it is. This treatise can tell you the location of harvesting spots for the ingredient. Just be careful -- This is closely guarded information. |

Give the players lots of changes to pick up on this by using a lot of imagery when describing their foraging.

#### Making Potions:
Regardless of how the player finds the ingredients, they will need to find the materials to make 3 randomly chose potions (given that the potions can be made using only ingredients from [[The Twilight Woods]]). Once they do so they can attempt to create the potion using their chosen kit, between herbalism, poisoners, and alchemists. (Refer to: [[Potions with Herbalism Kit]], [[Potions with Poisoner's Kit]], [[Potions with Alchemist's Supplies]] for more details)
#### Choosing a potion kit:
Players can choose one of the following:
- Alchemist's Kit
- Poisoner's Kit
- Herbalism's Kit

This will determine what potions you can make. The potions are you can craft are reliant on the kit that you are using to make the potions.
### Potions List:
[[Potions with Alchemist's Supplies]], [[Potions with Herbalism Kit]], [[Potions with Poisoner's Kit]]. Some potions will on display in the shop run by [[Pombo Wrinkle, the Short One]] and he can suggest some good ones one each kit that the players could use. 
#### How to make potions:
Refer to [[How to Make Potions]] to have this information. General idea is that you need either an Alchemist's, Herbalism, or Poisoner's kit to create the potions. You also need ingredients, but that part is done earlier.

# Reward:
If the player completes this challenge, they will get access to potion crafting. They will gain proficiency in their chosen kit (herbalism, alchemist, or poisoners) and they will gain a level in potion making.

# Conjuring Druid-Related Spells:
I think for this one, the idea of having the player search for a shine that has inscribed on it knowledge of how to cast a specific spell would be good. Then to test their skill they have to use the spell to complete a couple skill challenges to use the spell to solve problems or something.

Basically have them learn the spell and then use it in creative ways to teach them its power. They have them use it in combat against an animated enemy. 

#### Spells and Their Shrines:
There are three shrines with three possible spells to learn. It takes a full day to learn from a shrine its power and the shrine is designed to test anyone who seeks to obtain its knowledge.
- [Freedom of the Waves](https://5e.tools/spells.html#freedom%20of%20the%20waves_tdcsr)
	- 3rd-level conjuration
	- Casting Time: 1 action
	- Range: 120 feet
	- Components: V, S, M (a strand of wet hair)
	- Duration: Instantaneous
	- Description: You conjure a deluge of seawater in a 15-foot-radius, 10-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point within range. This water takes the form of a tidal wave, a whirlpool, a waterspout, or another form of your choice. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. You can choose a number of creatures equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of 1) to automatically succeed on this saving throw. 
	- If you are within the spell's area, as part of the action you use to cast the spell, you can vanish into the deluge and teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within the spell's area.
	- The following is the location and challenge for this spell:
	> #### Shrine Description: 
	> This shrine is made from sea stones, hewn into beautifully intricate inscriptions. As you walk closer to the temple, you can hear the crashing of ocean waves and the fragrant scent of sea salt. Each wall of the temple has inscriptions of behavior of the ocean. ![[Twilight forest temple of Waves.png]]

- [Call Lightning](https://5e.tools/spells.html#call%20lightning_phb)
	- 3rd-level conjuration
	- Casting Time: 1 action
	- Range: 120 feet
	- Components: V, S
	- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
	- Description: A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).
	- When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.
	- If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.
	- At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
	> #### Shrine Description:
	> This shrine is shrouded with mist and rests atop an open hill in a small clearing. As you approach you can hear the rumbling of storms, the scent of ozone, and a cool breeze in the face. The sides of the shrine are dark stone and engraved with deep, intricate pictures of storms and lightning.  ![[Twilight woods shrine to the storm.png]]

- [Erupting Earth](https://5e.tools/spells.html#erupting%20earth_xge)
	- 3rd-level transmutation
	- Casting Time: 1 action
	- Range: 120 feet
	- Components: V, S, M (a piece of obsidian)
	- Duration: Instantaneous
	- Description: Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
	- At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.
	> #### Shrine Description: 
	> This shrine sits in a small clearing with packed sandstone surrounding it. The shrine is made from tan, clay bricks. It has depictions of earthquakes and tremors. When you walk to it, despite the cool of the forest, you feel hot and your face feels dry. You can hear the rustling of sand whistling in the background and the ground feels warm. ![[Twilight woods shrine to earthquakes.png]]

### Challenges:
The challenges should appeal to as many different ways that the player could possibly use the spell that they are going to the shrine of. The spells should require the player to read about aspects of the spell from its description, become familiar with how it works and then use parts of it to try and pass certain challenges.

Important: Do NOT be rigid with how this spell should be used. Be very flexible within the wording of the spell as to what a player can attempt to do. If it extreme, require an **arcana check** to see if it is as effective as the player was hoping. 

# Reward:
If the player completes this challenge, they will get some spell casting abilities from the Druid spell list. For each spell ritual completed, they will get access to that spell, usable once per long rest without expending a spell slot. The spell gets added to their list of learned spells.
