# Mission Overview:
A task issued by [[The Green Order]] in order to become on of their ranks. It is the only way for a non-druidic, non-elvish person to be accepted as a native member, or at the very least a friendly, of the Green Order.

The party will seek to learn about the heritage of the Green Order through trials of the forest. Their meta-gaming goal will be to learn aspects of the Druid class:
-  Animal shaping and behavior
-  Nature and plant skills, used for potion making
-  Conjuring of nature-related spells

Their reward could be one of the following, corresponding to what they learn:
-  Limited wild shape abilities.
-  Limited spell casting from the Druid spell list.
-  Nature and Survival proficiencies. (or expertise if proficiency is already obtained)
-  A new language: Elvish
-  Proficiency in perception (from tracking)
-  Rare:
	-  Trance abilities from Elvish racial features
	-  The fey ancestry feat, giving [[advantage]] on being [[charmed]].

# Studying Animals (Wild Shape Training):
List of Animals within [[The North-East Forests]] (allowable for Wild-Shape, sorted by CR):
-  CR 1/4:
	-  Wolf
	-  Reindeer
	-  Panther
	-  Giant Snail
	-  Giant Wolf-Spider
	-  Elk 
-  CR 1:
	-  Dire Wolf
	-  Brown Bear
	-  Giant Rocktopus (spec)
	-  Moonbounder 
Have the players roll a History check or something to try and deduce what kind of animals could be found in the [[The Twilight Woods]]. This is NOT a full list, but it is a good couple that the player could refer to. 

A note on difficulty: A CR 1/4 creature is easier to emulate than a CR 1 creature. If setting DCs, they should be a little higher for CR 1 and the number of success required (if thinking in terms of a skill check challenge) should be slightly higher for the task list below.

> I am NOT going to write the *exact* list of tasks that a player would need to emulate for each individual creature and rather stick to a list of generic tasks that are generalized. Ethan, you should create the tasks on the fly if a player chooses a creature:

**Task List**:
-  Learn how to walk and move like the creature.
	-  Series of Stealth, Acrobatics, and Athletics checks. 
-  Learn how to survive as the creature (get food, water, and shelter).
	-  This is just foraging, no check here, just learn how the creature forages and copy what they do. 
-  Learn how to fight as the creature (e.g. emulate combat abilities and tactics).
	-  No check, but you have to survive combat. Combat should place the followed creature in a 1v1 with an enemy and you in a 1v1 with the same type of enemy. Make sure the followed creature's 1v1 transpires first so the player can observe it. 
-  Learn how to take care of the creature's young.
	-  Animal handling check, done with [[advantage]] if you have food from earlier.

# Studying Nature and Plants:
Refer to [[Potions Ingredients, Harvestable]] and  [[Potion Ingredients, Forageable]] for the full lists of gatherable ingredients. This challenge takes place within the [[The Twilight Woods]], so will pull out a small subset of the list to use for this mission. 

Useful resource for potion brewing in DND:  [Potion's Website](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MNG6P6I8-1tJM3aroaV). I think emulating the system in here would be great to sort of create this self contained kind of foraging adventure. It could be turned into a larger system for the party to always sort of have as something they can do during travels. 

Refer to the [[Potion Ingredients, Forageable]] and the [[Potions Ingredients, Harvestable]] lists for ingredients that can be found. Refine this down to a subset using the following guidelines:
- Plants here should rely on twilight, not full darkness, not full light to grow.
- They should feel whimsical and magical. 
- It is damp and moist here. Not hot. Nothing that would need direct light and a hot atmosphere here.
- No bold creatures. They should skulk and slink. 
- Creatures need to rely on darkvision and twilight to hunt.

List the Forageable ingredients here:
- forageable 1
- etc.

List the Harvestable ingredients here:
- Harvestable 1
- etc.

Now there is a list of ingredients, this is how they tie into this trial:
**Important: This will be BORING if it is just a challenge of -> Roll to find, find or don't, okay great that it!** 

The ingredients are both the focus and not the focus. They are the *reason* that the player will be searching but not the main entertainment. Every ingredient should have a clue that will be something like what follows:
- This ingredient is the favorite food of a specific creature; follow it and you can find it. But be careful, the ingredient is rare and the creature is hungry!
- This ingredient can only be found when the light from another, bio-luminescent ingredient is shone upon it. Otherwise it looks just like a normal thing.
- This ingredient is deadly poison and it looks exactly like another one which is delicious. Good luck figuring out which is which. 
- An ingredient is a prized by a small group in the forest. They can be bribed using it and will give something that is prized to you in return. 
Just link every ingredient with something that can be done to FIND that ingredient. Make multiple clues accessible in a given 'image' (or the scene that the player is in).

> **HOW TO GET THE CLUES:**
DO NOT: Just give the player the clues without any work. Don't give them just a book with all the knowledge in it. Make the player WORK to get the clues.

Regardless of how the player finds the ingredients, they will need to find the materials to make 3 randomly chose potions (given that the potions can be made using only ingredients from [[The Twilight Woods]]). Once they do so they can attempt to create the potion using their chosen kit, between herbalism, poisoners, and alchemists. (Refer to: [[Potions with Herbalism Kit]], [[Potions with Poisoner's Kit]], [[Potions with Alchemist's Supplies]] for more details)

List the possible potions here:
- Potions 1
- etc.

# Conjuring Druid-Related Spells:
I think for this one, the idea of having the player search for a shine that has inscribed on it knowledge of how to cast a specific spell would be good. Then to test their skill they have to use the spell to complete a couple skill challenges to use the spell to solve problems or something.

Basically have them learn the spell and then use it in creative ways to teach them its power. They have them use it in combat against an animated enemy. 

**List the appropriate spells here:**
Also list the challenges and trials the character will face if they choose to go after a given spell. This entire section should allow you to run the challenge.
- [Freedom of the Waves](https://5e.tools/spells.html#freedom%20of%20the%20waves_tdcsr)
	- 3rd-level conjuration
	- Casting Time: 1 action
	- Range: 120 feet
	- Components: V, S, M (a strand of wet hair)
	- Duration: Instantaneous
	- Description: You conjure a deluge of seawater in a 15-foot-radius, 10-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point within range. This water takes the form of a tidal wave, a whirlpool, a waterspout, or another form of your choice. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. You can choose a number of creatures equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of 1) to automatically succeed on this saving throw. 
	- If you are within the spell's area, as part of the action you use to cast the spell, you can vanish into the deluge and teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within the spell's area.
	- The following is the location and challenge for this spell:
	> **Shine description:** This shrine is made from sea stones, hewn into beautifully intricate inscriptions. As you walk closer to the temple, you can hear the crashing of ocean waves and the fragrant scent of sea salt. Each wall of the temple has inscriptions of behavior of the ocean. ![[Twilight forest temple of Waves.png]]

- [Call Lightning](https://5e.tools/spells.html#call%20lightning_phb)
	- 3rd-level conjuration
	- Casting Time: 1 action
	- Range: 120 feet
	- Components: V, S
	- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
	- Description: A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).
	- When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.
	- If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.
	- At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
	> **Shrine Description:** This shrine is shrouded with mist and rests atop an open hill in a small clearing. As you approach you can hear the rumbling of storms, the scent of ozone, and a cool breeze in the face. The sides of the shrine are dark stone and engraved with deep, intricate pictures of storms and lightning.  ![[Twilight woods shrine to the storm.png]]

- [Erupting Earth](https://5e.tools/spells.html#erupting%20earth_xge)
	- 3rd-level transmutation
	- Casting Time: 1 action
	- Range: 120 feet
	- Components: V, S, M (a piece of obsidian)
	- Duration: Instantaneous
	- Description: Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
	- At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.
	> **Shrine Description:** This shrine sits in a small clearing with packed sandstone surrounding it. The shrine is made from tan, clay bricks. It has depictions of earthquakes and tremors. When you walk to it, despite the cool of the forest, you feel hot and your face feels dry. You can hear the rustling of sand whistling in the background and the ground feels warm. ![[Twilight woods shrine to earthquakes.png]]
