Preamble:
This mission is to be completed for Deion. He has a score to settle with [[Garrick Blackthorn]] and [[The Iron-fist Marauders]]. It will involve the scouting, infiltration, sneaking, deceiving, and dethroning of Garrick from the Marauders. This is a long quest.

# Phase One:
Somehow the party has to get into [[The Blood-Stone Pass]]. It is heavily patrolled and monitored by [[The Iron-fist Marauders]]. Brute forcing their way in will be disastrous. To get past the entry gate, they will need to be smart and cunning.
# Phase Two:
Now the party has to get into [[The Bastion of Blood]]. That is given that the party has figured out that [[Garrick Blackthorn]] resides here. Now the party has to sneak their way into the Bastion. Either that, or they brute force their way in. But this will likely result in capture or death. There are many ways in: breaking into the sewers or a couple secret passage ways.

# Phase Three:
Confrontation. Now the party may end up in a combat with [[Garrick Blackthorn]]. This will likely be brutal, final combat and the conclusion to the mission.

# Wrap-up:
The party, namely Deion, will need to find a way to succeed Garrick if they win. They will need to replace him and his inner council with someone who will be firm and confident to rule, but will also be good, reliable, and honorable. No more tyranny. 

Here is where it has the potential to be really interesting. Since the party has kill Garrick, they get to choose the successor. That means the party has the chance to uplift or ruin the Marauders:
- If they choose well, the organization will change for the better.
- If they choose wrong, the organization will undergo a hostile take-over. They will become war-like and dangerous. They will unify, attempt to take over the other groups guarding the mountain passes and cause a clan war between all the groups. 
	- This is the fun option. But it cannot be forced. It should be for the purpose of expanding the story. But it cannot be forced. 
	- If they choose a good candidate, then maybe a rival group that wanted power will take over the organization forcefully. Don't trick the players; don't suddenly make a candidate that they wanted turn evil behind their backs. That's not how this should work. 
	- If they choose a good person, so be it. Let this part fold out a different way. But it needs to fold out.
