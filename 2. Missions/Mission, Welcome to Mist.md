Welcome to Mist adventurers. I hope you enjoy the many, many adventures that are yet to come. 
# An Intro to Mist
	Some live amidst the swaying grass of the north-west highlands. Some make their homes in the deep forests of the north-east. Some brave the treacherous paths of the south-east mountains. Some lead lives of mischief and bravery along the south-east coast. Some brave souls make their stands in the hot deserts of the south-west. But all who live here, make their lives on Mist.
