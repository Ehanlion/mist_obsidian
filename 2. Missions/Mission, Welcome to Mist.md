Welcome to Mist adventurers. I hope you enjoy the many, many adventures that are yet to come. 
# An Intro to Mist
	Some live amidst the swaying grass of the north-west highlands. Some make their homes in the deep forests of the north-east. Some brave the treacherous paths of the south-east mountains. Some lead lives of mischief and bravery along the south-east coast. Some brave souls make their stands in the hot deserts of the south-west. But all who live here, make their lives on Mist.

#### Town's Guard in the Tavern:
Walking through town you hear murmurings of people being taken or having gone missing from towns up the coast from [[Saddle-Port]]. 

**The Tavern:**
A man by the name of [[Jordan Leabrook]] is the town's guard. He knows a little about people going missing up the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]]. He is motivated to learn more about the missing people because none have gone missing from [[Saddle-Port]] yet, and since he has kids, he wants to make sure that they are not in danger.
