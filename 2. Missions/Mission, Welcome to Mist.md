Welcome to Mist adventurers. I hope you enjoy the many, many adventures that are yet to come. 
# An Intro to Mist
	Some live amidst the swaying grass of the north-west highlands. Some make their homes in the deep forests of the north-east. Some brave the treacherous paths of the south-east mountains. Some lead lives of mischief and bravery along the south-east coast. Some brave souls make their stands in the hot deserts of the south-west. But all who live here, make their lives on Mist. 

# First Beginnings
The adventure begins in [[The North-West Highlands]], in the village of [[Saddle-Port]]. This is [[Kelswin Lovejoy]]'s home village. 
#### Introducing Characters:

# Hooks

| Town's Guard in the Tavern | There have been multiple cases of people missing up the coast. It is known that two of the people missing are Librarians from other villages. |
| Poor Merchant | A merchant is town had his boat sunk just off shore. He couldn't retrieve his lockbox with his valuables in it and needs it returned or he faces ruin. |
These are the two main hooks for adventure. Either one of them will end up with Vivian getting taken and the group having to choose to follow or to give up.

___
## Town's Guard in the Tavern:
Walking through town you hear murmurings of people being taken or having gone missing from towns up the coast from [[Saddle-Port]]. 

#### The Tavern:
A man by the name of [[Jordan Leabrook]] is the town's guard. He knows a little about people going missing up the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]]. He is motivated to learn more about the missing people because none have gone missing from [[Saddle-Port]] yet, and since he has kids, he wants to make sure that they are not in danger. 

#### Jordan's Suggestions:
Jordan recommends that the group stages a stake-out for the next week in order to wait to see if anything pops up. If the group does not like that, they can also choose to venture up to the next town called [[Smears-burrow]] and ask about the vanishings there. 

##### Heading up to Smears-burrow:
[[Smears-burrow]] is a 3 day trip north along the coast of [[The North-West Highlands]]. If they leave to go there, the raid, as detailed in [[The Vanishings in the North-West]], will occur on [[Saddle-Port]] while they are gone, [[Vivian Lovejoy]] will be captured, and the tavern will be burned down. 

##### Conducting a Stake-Out:
Staging the stake-out will bear results after 3 days. At that point a raid will occur on the town. The raiders want to take [[Vivian Lovejoy]] because she is a librarian and that is the only person they need from the town. 

They group cannot win -- the raiding part is large and powerful. The good new is that they are trying to take [[Vivian Lovejoy]], cause damage, and run. The group can play defensive and try to protect the town or they can try to kill the aggressors.

___
## Poor Merchant in the Tavern:
If you enter the tavern, it becomes clear that someone is very sad. A merchant sits at a table with 10s of drinks surrounding him. 

#### The Poor Merchant:
A captain of a merchant vessel by the name of Stanley Maples is bemoaning the loss of his ship. It sank not far off the shore of [[Saddle-Port]], at a point off the coast, about a days journey up the coast. He need people to retrieve the lock box and he can't do it; the ship is sunk in over 100 feet of water.

#### The Stan-ta Ray:
The ship is a small merchant vessel. It has the strong box located in the helm. It is locked with a DC 20 Slight of Hand check needed to open it. The bigger issue is that the ship is in 100 feet of water, making getting down to it a difficult task. 

> Easter Egg, but the ship is called 'The Stan-ta Ray,' a joke after Gravity Fall's 'Stan-of-War.'

The ship sunk directly out to sea from a small sea cave. This sea cave is empty, but upon examination people can see that it is clearly being used. The sea cave is being used by a group of raiders, as detailed in [[The Vanishings in the North-West]]. When the group is exploring the ship, they will find the cave abandoned but they can explore it.
#### A Mysterious Sea Cave:
They will find multiple cages, multiple tridents, and lots of rope. They will also find a the mauled corpse of a miner. Examining it closer will reveal numerous wounds, indicating he died while struggling. He has a pick-axe on him with the initials R.B. He is missing from the town of [[Smears-burrow]]. 

**things to find:**
1. Tridents
2. 30 Sleeping cots
3. Multiple, Large Cages
4. Around 10 Spools of Rope.
5. A dead corpse: it is a miner, he died while struggling, a pickaxe with initials R.B can be found near his body. He was from [[Smears-burrow]].
6. A locked crate: DC 15 Slight of Hand to pick, reveals a strange, wet herb and multiple glowing vials. It is Gillyweed and paralysis potions.

Investigation reveals that this cave is home to nearly 30 creatures -- a massive amount. 
#### Reward:
The captain will offer anyone who returns his lock box half of what it contains -- a total sum of 500 gold of gems and jewels. 

___

	That is the end of the first part of the mission. Either they explore with Jarod or they help the merchant. In all cases, a raid occurs on the village and vivian will be taken. This should jump-start the group to continue the trails to find out more about the vanishings.
