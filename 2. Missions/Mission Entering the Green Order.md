# Mission Overview:
A task issued by [[The Green Order]] in order to become on of their ranks. It is the only way for a non-druidic, non-elvish person to be accepted as a native member, or at the very least a friendly, of the Green Order.

The party will seek to learn about the heritage of the Green Order through trials of the forest. Their meta-gaming goal will be to learn aspects of the Druid class:
-  Animal shaping and behavior
-  Nature and plant skills
-  Conjuring of nature-related spells

Their reward could be one of the following, corresponding to what they learn:
-  Limited wild shape abilities.
-  Limited spell casting from the Druid spell list.
-  Nature and Survival proficiencies. (or expertise if proficiency is already obtained)
-  A new language: Elvish
-  Proficiency in perception (from tracking)
-  Rare:
	-  Trance abilities from Elvish racial features
	-  The fey ancestry feat, giving [[advantage]] on being [[charmed]].

# Studying Animals (Wild Shape Training):
List of Animals within [[The North-East Forests]] (allowable for Wild-Shape, sorted by CR):
-  CR 1/4:
	-  Wolf
	-  Reindeer
	-  Panther
	-  Giant Snail
	-  Giant Wolf-Spider
	-  Elk 
-  CR 1:
	-  Dire Wolf
	-  Brown Bear
	-  Giant Rocktopus (spec)
	-  Moonbounder 

A note on difficulty: A CR 1/4 creature is easier to emulate than a CR 1 creature. If setting DCs, they should be a little higher for CR 1 and the number of success required (if thinking in terms of a skill check challenge) should be slightly higher for the task list below.

I am NOT going to write the *exact* list of tasks that a player would need to emulate for each individual creature and rather stick to a list of generic tasks that are generalized:

**Task List**:
-  Learn how to walk and move like the creature.
	-  Series of Stealth, Acrobatics, and Athletics checks. 
-  Learn how to survive as the creature (get food, water, and shelter).
	-  This is just foraging, no check here, just learn how the creature forages and copy what they do. 
-  Learn how to fight as the creature (e.g. emulate combat abilities and tactics).
	-  No check, but you have to survive combat. Combat should place the followed creature in a 1v1 with an enemy and you in a 1v1 with the same type of enemy. Make sure the followed creature's 1v1 transpires first so the player can observe it. 
-  Learn how to take care of the creature's young.
	-  Animal handling check, done with [[advantage]] if you have food from earlier. 

# Studying Nature and Plants:
Refer to [[The North-East Forests Plant List]]: for a full list. This challenge takes place within the [[The Twilight Woods]], so I will use a list of plant just for this area.
