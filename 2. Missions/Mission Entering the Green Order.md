# Mission Overview:
A task issued by [[The Green Order]] in order to become on of their ranks. It is the only way for a non-druidic, non-elvish person to be accepted as a native member, or at the very least a friendly, of the Green Order.

The party will seek to learn about the heritage of the Green Order through trials of the forest. Their meta-gaming goal will be to learn aspects of the Druid class:
-  Animal shaping and behavior
-  Nature and plant skills
-  Conjuring of nature-related spells
-  Hunting and tracking (more ranger-like)

They can get from this:
-  Limited wild shape abilities.
-  Limited spell casting from the Druid spell list.
-  Nature and Survival proficiencies. (or expertise if proficiency is already obtained)
-  A new language: Elvish
-  Proficiency in perception (from tracking)
-  Rare:
	-  Trance abilities from Elvish racial features
	-  The fey ancestry feat, giving [[advantage]] on being [[charmed]].
