1. **The History**: what are the creature of the [[The Scorchsand Wastes]]
2. **The Evolution**: why did they evolve, what is their evolution 
3. **The Danger**: what is the danger, how are folks cautioned
# The History
## The Past of the Wastes
- The creatures of [[The Scorchsand Wastes]] are sand-dwellers, e.g. they live in the sands of the wastes
- They hunt the prey that is forced to cross the wastes as well as other creatures in the wastes
- It is best to visualize the wastes as *an inland sea made of sand*, since the dynamics are mostly similar to that of an oceanic ecosystem
- The creatures here hunt for the following, in order of priority
	- food and water, sustenance and living are the drivers of the wasters over anything else
	- domain control, creatures mark "stakes" in the wastes and control those domains from other same-species creatures
## A list of Potential Creatures
This list goes from **Apex** at the top to **Feed** at the bottom:
1. Sand Dragons
2. Sandworms (yeah, like Dune)
3. Young Sandworms
4. Tremor Shark Packs
5. Large Rhino Beetles
6. Sand Spiders
# The Evolution
## Why Evolution Happened
- In the past 1000 years of Mist, [[The Scorchsand Wastes]] have seen traversal through the ages.  
- In the early days, this was dangerous but not nearly as bad as now
- As more and more crossings happened to fuel the growing society on [[The Fractured Coast]] the creatures **evolved**
	- these crossings are needed because [[The Fractured Coast]] has very little agriculture
	- thus they need support from the North and from [[Gandoras City]] and [[The Seat of Stone]] 
- What was this **evolution?**
- It was a *natural scent for the weave*, e.g. a new scent allowing them to detect when the Weave is manipulated by creatures
	- Whenever a creatures *casts a spell or uses any magic,* the weave is invoked
	- This leaves a lasting trace, like a trail leading to the caster.
	- Any spell, including cantrips, does this, the more powerful the spell the larger the scent, the more powerful a prey
- The weaker spells attracts lesser creatures while more powerful spells often attract the greater hunters of the wastes
- Mages for centuries used spells like **Goodberry,** or **Water Manipulation Spells** to make their crossings trivial, hence this extra scent 
- This is well known, and is given as a warning at any crossing post
## The Scent
- Creatures of the wastes can smell **Spells and Magic** casted
- The *so called scent* given off by a given spell (cantrips to 9th level spells) is proportional to the spell's power, a higher level means a stronger signature
- Even the most dangerous of creatures *can be attracted by the weakest of spells*
- The strength of the scent is more an indicator of *how many things* are alerted, *not what* is alerted
# The Danger
## Understanding the Danger
- If a creature **chooses** to cast a spell, so be it
- They run the risks of attracting something
- Tables ranging from minor to major threats should be used
- Prolific usage of magic (e.g. lots of usage and NOT powerful usage) should invoke a major threat table roll
	- The most lethal factor is the amount of magic used
	- Thus abide by the following rule: **Amount of Magic Used** **>>>** **Power of Magic Used**
- **Minor Table Odds**:
	- **40%** Nothing happens
	- **40%** Minor, single-event, threats
	- **20%** Major, highly threatening effects
	- 1-8, 9-16, 17-20 Brackets
	- Break up each bracket into individual, related events
- **Major Table Odds**:
	- **10%** Nothing happens
	- **40%** Minor, single-event, threats
	- **50%** Major, highly threatening effects
	- 1-2, 3-10, 11-20 Brackets
	- Break up each bracket into individual, related events, share minor events with minor table
- Roll on these tables **Every time magic is used**
- The amount of magic used should be gauged as the number of spells continuing to be cast. 
	- Like for instance a spell is cast early in the day -> minor
	- Then another 2 spells are cast later in the day -> borderline, use minor for each one
	- Then another spell is cast -> that's a lot, major table for each spell now cast
- **A threshold** can be set for a given adventure, maybe **3 spells, or 4** as the border between Minor to Major Table transitions 

## Rules of Thumb
- **Always roll after combat on the Major Table**
