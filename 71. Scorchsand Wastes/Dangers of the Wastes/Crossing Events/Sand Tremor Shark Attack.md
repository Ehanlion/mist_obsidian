Regional Location: [[The Scorchsand Wastes]]
Subsection: A **deadly** danger event, apart of the [[Dangers of the Wastes]]

> [!NOTE] The Sand Shakes Beneath Your Feet ...
> The sand shakes beneath your feet, that means something dangerous comes your way. You can see a grouping of fins cutting through the sand like a hot knife through butter. They zig and they zag as the swarm closer to your location. As they approach, you can feel the sand tremor beneath your feet as the sand fights your movement. 

In this event **a group of tremor sharks** attack. Tremor sharks hunt in packs, they have a **recharge ability** that allows them to cause a *liquefaction effect* in the sand, at best slowing but at its most deadly, ensnaring and trapping their prey. They feed on *blood, meat, and water* and will *always* prioritize a target they have trapped or slowed over a free-moving one.
